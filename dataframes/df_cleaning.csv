1. Diplomacy . It is joke. Nothing works. You have trade and military access with CAO CAO ? War declaration next turn. You are too small ? well you will get war declaration each turn . In this game its ok if you are at war with more factions than you have armies.  Oh and if you are too big ? guess what ? still war each turn. i mean did they even test this diplomacy ? 3 war declaration in t run ? for nothing ?i am total war  veteran and i can see what they have done with AI. Rather than improve it and make it play by the rules like paradox have done. They rather make AI cheat and brake rules like having ,,shadow income"".  Or have some sort of punishment for breaking pacts. Like in EU4 where your stability drops if you declare war without reason or attack enemy that just signed peace with you.
2. Troops. In TWH( also in Rome) all is simple. You have about 3 chains of troop buildings that supply you with certain kind of troops. Wanna have artillery ? ok just build artillery school or something like that. Wanna have special units ? just build building that provides them. Here if you want artillery you must hire strategist in order to get it. so instead of having vanguard that could kill solo 200 guys you now  must buy a useless fucking turd who will just sit in back and do nothing. Oh you want special units like axes ? well hire sentinel. Oh you do not have any sentinels in army or even in faction ? oh too bad then . Like why you change something that was working fine ?instead of fixing shit that was in last total wars.
3. city building.  tons of buildings that you WONT build because you know why ? they buff are fucking useless and honestly if i had task to create even more useless buildings i would fail. I did not build a single building from military besides that one building which buffs garrisons . Imagine playing Rome without  single military building ?  or grain storage ? CA i have only a couple of fucking slots and you expect me to waste them on fucking grain storage ? only because it city could live for 2 turns more under siege ?",1562590376,1562590376,False,0.0,False,False,False,413,en

[h1]About the Game[/h1]
Play as a warlord in the tumultuous Three Kingdoms era. Manage settlements and diplomacy even as you lead your armies to victories on the battlefield. Choose between a more historical realistic mode and the romance mode that places emphasis on the generals by increasing their influence in the game. 

In the game itself, players manage the development of settlements on the map so that give a mix of money (identified as sourced from peasantry, commerce, or industry), food (important for upkeeping large cities and how long your cities can stand a siege), and unique resources for unique buildings.

Armies compose of 3 generals with a retinue of 6 units each. Settlements also maintain their own garrisons depending on the level. 

When armies/garrisons come across each other, they may go into battle if you're at war with the other faction. 

Battlefields are varied depending on the map and will have an effect on how strong some units are (forests hide units, dampens the effectiveness of arrows). Some battlefields will see the nearby ally/garrison adding to the field as well.

As with other TK games, the battle is won by decimating the opponent forces and ruining their morale by killing them and other means. Generals play a part in this as they have skills to boost and hurt units.

Generals can also duel each other (iconic to RTK). The outcome will have impact on the morale of the troops and can lead to death and capture of the general. Some generals duel better than other, obviously.

You can boost General skills as they level up, choosing capability that range from personal effectiveness in battle, more passive buffs to their units, and effectiveness as administrators that can be assigned to boost settlements instead of leading armies.

The aim is to blob your dominion and rise through the ranks until you become the undisputed leader of China.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Like many Total War games, the battlefield is spectacular. The franchise in general has been adding more strategy components into the game and Three Kingdoms is no exception. Management of resources and character traits have important bearing to the outcome of the battles. This is a worthy add on to anyone who loves RTK-themed games.

[h1]Pluses and Minuses[/h1]
+ Total War battlefields with enhanced strategic cities-on-map layer.
+ Excellent visuals ranging from the ink animation to the general potraits.
+ Excellent voice acting.
+ Pinyin translation of the names ensure an easier read with less hard consonants and apostrophes. 
+ Good balance between actual RTK characters and system generated characters.
+ Romance mode weaves in stories and progression based on the Classic text (e.g. you the Three-Visits event as Liu Bei)

- Most of the less famous people look too similar.
- The need to diversify your army between a choice of Sentinel, Vanguard, Advisor, Commander, etc. feels artificial.

The good:
The game's sound, graphics and mechanics are all solid. It's challenging and fun and gives you the full total war experience with quite a couple of departures, twists and new mechanics to keep it interesting. The best thing about it? It's stable as f@ck! It's the smoothest most responsive total war experience yet. Everything looks great and it just works! Not a single crash in all the time I played and for a Total War game that's really saying something. Also no sudden frame rate drops, memory leaks or crazy frustrating glitches. This one was polished! Thank the gods!

The bad:
I only have one major gripe with Three Kingdoms and that's replay value. There are a ton of factions in the game, sure and each does have two or three units that are unique to them but for the most part the factions are all the same so after the immensely fun 100+ hours I took to finish a campaign I feel uninterested in going back and playing with a new faction. It feels like it would just be the same experience again with the starting difficulty adjusted. Most previous Total War games didn't have this problem, take Total War: Warhammer for instance, there you're given the option to play with a completely new race in each play through where each race has entirely different units and the mechanics of each differ on the campaign map as well as the battlefield.

Conclusion:
If you're a Total War fan or you like realistic strategy games then this is for you. It's an absolute pleasure to play. It's challenging and has a lot of aspects to master and keep track of. If you're one of those people who have one game on their PC and only plays the same game over and over again, well, this one might not be for you XD
Basically Three Kindgoms is still in the top 3 best Total War games ever it's just not number one because of the replay value and variety on the board.

The Long-ish: 

True this game needs a bit beefy system but I am telling you it feels so good to turn a losing battle into a victory. All comes down to strategy in this game and how you balance money, food and diplomacy. Furthermore, the UI is so slick and stylish while also informative!

Pros:
+ Since every faction is using almost the same units, the game only ever feels as unfair as your starting location/strength

+ I love the romance mode, it really adds flavour to what could otherwise be quite a bland game (Though Shogun 2 is great, i 
always tire of seeing the same units fight all the time)

+ The game never gets ""too easy"". As you grow bigger, all the other factions grow bigger with you and/or form coalitions to counter you. This prevents you from steamrolling up until the final stage of the game.

+ Really cool maps! Both the battle maps and the campaign map look really nice and offer unique gameplay experiences.

Cons:
- I miss boats. All the recent total war titles have neglected naval warfare and this is no exception. I really miss the playstyle opportunities that came with naval units. (Playing as GB in Empire, Carthage in Rome or Boat-clan in Shogun)

- Duels feel quite boring. When i read about duels i was really excited and tought they looked awesome, but after playing the actual game i feel like they are an option i just never want to use. If your commander is stronger then you want to duel but the enemy doesnt want to and if you are weaker then there is no point in dueling.

Overall:
Currently my favorite Total war game, but i feel it lacks the replayability of the games with bigger faction differences (Rome or Warhammer)

I like how well the game works on my current setup and it seems to be better optimised in my case. 

Pros for me: 
- Diplomacy = actually something that works well for a TW title 
- Character levelling, relationships and perks seem to all work well in this title
- Map size - actually much bigger than I thought when i starting playing campaign 
- Large scale battles - has some really epic moments especially when your against the odds

Cons for me: 
-     AI is still not great - Example: under siege from 1 full army plus reinforcements who all funnelled into one wall section that was sapped. the reinforcement army had to circle around the whole city pretty much to get there whilst under fire from towers and becoming fully fatigued. XD 
-  Series of events such as main character deaths all seem to be the same in my playthroughs

Three Kingdoms isn't any different. If you love history, if you love semi-realistic strategy games, if you love watching honorable (or dishonorable) warriors clashing up close with swords, halberds, spears and axes, while at the same time building yourself a massive, respected empire, this is the game for you.

Yes, you can play this game as a warmonger or a pacifist, there are playable characters created specifically with both styles in mind. Conquer with force, or through diplomacy. Your call.

And if you're new to Total War, do not worry, I could easily argue that this one is the easiest one to pick up and get into without being overly complicated like, say, Empire or Medieval 2.

Graphics are not to be scoffed at, perhaps they aren't the greatest, but graphics aren't everything, and what it DOES HAVE, makes it completeley gorgeous, you'd be an idiot to not see the beauty in Three Kingdoms.

What I managed to play of the co-op campaign is fun and suprisingly stable. In fact, in my hundreds of campaigns, I rarely ever had glitches or bugs, the occasional crash perhaps but those have been patched out, and any other causes of it will follow shortly after.

Dynasty Warriors fans, ROTK fans, Total War fans. RTS fans, this game is a MUST in your collection already, it's beautiful, it's (mostly) historically accurate to what China was like back then, it's fun, and to those who care for it, it's easily moddable. (Especially now that the official Workshop got added)

It's impossible to NOT like this game unless you're an absolute tool, by which case what would you even be doing here? This game is worth grabbing, at any price, be it full or discount, you're going to get your money's worth with every hour you play. I certainly did. 

Just be careful with the diplomacy, even if the AI acts dumb, it won't appreciate you offering them food and rice in exchange for their territory, only for you to cancel the deal and keep their territory anyway :P",1562401025,1562401025,True,0.0,True,False,False,376,en

I read someone complaining the computer had 3 stacks. If you still haven't figured how to counter this then you haven't figured out total war games. Hint, create a smaller army, put a full stack in ambush mode, when the enemy goes for the smaller army you get to wipe out a stack. Or use night battles which doesn't allow reinforcements (Lightning strike in warhammer). You take some losses, retreat and slowly wear the enemy down. Come on, it's Three kingdoms, the war went on for decades and EVERYONE lost apart from one winning faction, and you want to win this game on cruise control? I started on legendary and played at least 20 times on before I managed to win, because I was wiped out early game 20 times. Takes the strategy out of strategy games if it's too easy, figure out the mechanics yourself. A warlord isn't a snowflake. 

As for game mechanics. I'll mention what I love most and hate most. I love the fact that the game is still challenging after early game, almost all previous total war games, it's hard at the start and if you survive then you bulldoze everyone else. Here you really have to becareful because if you start a war with the wrong coalition they will still wipe you out late game. So you get a challenge throughout.

As for bad points, small ones. Sometimes it's not clear who declared war on me because of the coalition mechanics. So I have to constantly check the diplomacy window in case I'm at war with a faction and don't even know. Also Warhammer fixed this, but we have this problem again. If an army is on forced march, and you forget to switch back to normal march, if you move it just a little and it's not even full distance then you can't switch back that turn. 

It's just small negative issues. Overall a great total war I feel is even better than Shogun and far better than Rome 2. Well balanced game unless you're a hater.",1562397113,1562397113,True,0.0,True,False,False,380,en

Pretty polished from day 1 (well, for total war standards).

Cons:
-In the second half of the game most unique characters are dead, except the ones of your faction, but those start to get old
-Most of the action is only in the upper half of the campaign map 
-The unit variety is not as small as in shogun, but is pretty small
-Some minor balancing issues
-Even though there is a historical mode (normal historical total war), the game was developed with the romance mode (super human special characters with some rpg elements) and you can feel it when playing historical mode
-Medium balancing issues (mostly minors, but in romance mode some heroes are OP, looking at you Lü Bu)
-Battle AI is not the brightest
-no see combat (although that did not work since the days of empire, but I liked my fleets)

Pros:
-Many of the total war systems that worked well in past entries made it to this one while the ones that did not work out well were purged. So if you want to have the good parts of former titles here they are
-Army composition depending on the types of generals (max 3) you put into one army works very well.
-Siege battles are back
-Graphics are pretty good and I did not notice any major graphic related bugs so far (not like in rome 2 with its flying ships after landing your troops)
-Diplomacy is finally working (a bit) and worth your efforts
-Battle AI does its job if you dont cheese it (if you do it fails horribly)
-Big battles in ancient china
-Although relatively easy, managing your empire has an ok amount of complexity while not being a pain in the *** at any stage of the game.

Besides the immersion of the Romance of the Three Kingomds era (which I follow through movies and Dynasty Warriors and Tactics games), Total War 3K provides a decent challenge for the TW fan.

   The atmosphere, as said, is great, providing great immersion into the 3K world, with full character development, along sie with the changes on the friends and enemies, as the rise and fall of each warlord.

   The diplomacy system is finally a logic one (except on the Vassal vs attacker with agreement dilemma). Now you are provided with a percentage of willingness to accept deas from the other part, which helps you negotiating. Total War 3k surprises the player with a variety of deals (such as trade food, trade territory, start coalition) and encourages NPC's finally assuming these mechanics (for example, there will be alot of usage of the vassalizing system by the NPC's). In this game you must rely on a friendly diplomatic policy and gather a good number of strong allies and vassals, if you don't, you may be attacked by dozens of strong warlods with nothing to lose.

   The public order now also applies to the generals (satisfaction). You must be careful in the your general's characters development, because they may feel disgregarded by your rule, and eventually leave your service.

   The battles and simply great, fun and gratifiyng. Well, I can't say that the soundtrack didn't helped.

   The AI in battle is not bad, and I think the AI in campaign is actually good.

I have played a ton of Romance of the Three Kingdoms
I have played several iterations of Dynasty Warriors
I have put in a ton of game time in this game.

This captures most of the best of all of these.

This is easily my favorite Total War.
The combat mechanics feel solid. Im not overwhelmed with variations of the same unit as i have in some of the older games, and im not feeling like there is too little unit diversity either. Each unit feels like it exists for a role and lets you choose how you want to build your formations

The army mechanics are easily some of my favorite. I like having cool officer and his retinue of troops, I like combining those officers into armies with specific strengths and weaknesses based on army composition.

The Romance system is awesome. Letting me utilize real heroes on the battle field in ways that are specific to each one. whether its to stand there and encourage my troops, to terrify theirs, or to charge into the thick of battle and cut down the enemy.

The diplomacy is well done, with each faction having its own unique traits, but without everything feeling muddy. Each unique ability has its own solid flavor, and isn't overwhelming or underwhelming.

Overall the strategy overworld is a good balance between Total War and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, capturing ROTKs story line aspects, individuality and camaraderie in officers, while maintaining the Total War emphasis on grand strategy, economy management, and army positioning and maneuvering.
The Combat Simulation captures a solid balance between Total War Unit Management, alongside the more Dynasty Warrior feel of having these heroic officers roll in and do serious damage, without being completely unbeatable.

Two Aspects I miss from those other series though - 
Total War - The ability for a no-name guy to become and officer. Back in the day if an officer fell in Total War, or an army existed without an officer leading it (like city garrisons in Three Kingdoms), if they managed to win a victory, a new officer rose from the ranks as ""the guy who kept us together"". I understand why its not here, but thematically that was something i enjoyed back in the day.
ROTK - I always made my own character in these. I wish it were available in TW:3K. Give them a similar start as Zheng Jiang, where the first thing you do is seize your own holdings, and expand from there. Its not something i think has ever really existed in Total War, so again, I understand why it isn't there.",1562349558,1562349558,True,0.0,True,False,False,448,en

I was really sceptical about Three Kingdoms at first. Due to sudden change in my mind i preordered it few days before release, praying it wont be bad and honestly ...... its probably one of the best TW´s in history of TW and i dont feel bad for spending single euro on this. I certainly hope next TW´s in upcoming years will have alot of features from Three Kingdoms.

PROS:
Amazing campaing map gameplay
Amazing battle map gameplay
-> Finally it feels like brutal battles once again. Dont get me wrong, i love Warhammer but when i see cavalry crash into infantry and they loose like 10 men its really immersion breaking. Same goes to archers. But here? Shock cavalry crashing into infantry blob thats just carnage. Same goes to archers, they are finally not just support unit but actually viable mainstay unit in army
-> Battles are bit smaller (max units in each army are 3 heroes with 6 units each and each side can have two full stack armies. But this is actually good thing as battles feel just ""right"" and arent such clickfest.
Spy system
-> I was bit sceptical that this cant ever work but honestly while it is kinda RNG at times, it does work like charm and definitely better than old ""i send hero to enemy territory to just stand around""
Diplomacy system
-> It is actually working, in depth-developed system. Especially compared to previous TW´s ""diplomacy""
-> While AI´s still tend to be generally speaking backstabbing bastards (Yuan Shao i hate you just so you know) they are atleast logic-based backstabbing bastards. You usually know WHY the AI backstabbed you and its no longer ""AI: I am at peace for 20 turns, i must wage war .... hmm player with empire ten times size of mine, lets do this""
-> Point based accept/decline is finally in here and you finally know how much you must throw in to make AI say yes (althrough sometimes the AI views some things as either much more valuable or much less valuable than they really are)
GOOD OLD SIEGES ARE BACK IN THE GAME
-> No more D-Day equivalent where you run towards one wall with no room for manuever or even getting out of tower range
Heroes/Legendary characters
-> What else can i say? They are just awesome, both from historical perspective and from gameplay perspective
-> Definitely better made than in Warhammer games

NEUTRAL
Gonna be honest, China as campaing map is bit bland. Gameplay itself and mechanics tied to it are awesome, but playing on something that essentially lacks any chokepoints and is big ol´ round huge swath of land with AI that loves backstabbing you when you are waging war + AI love to just run deep into your territory to loot and burn

CONS
AI cheats
-> I know in every TW AI cheats. But here it just gets stupid. AI ignores several game mechanics that are important, like Food. Yep thats right. AI doesnt give a damn if they in brutal minus with food. They get no maluses from that. Upkeep reduction is soo huge even on Normal that AI sports units, for which you are paying 150, only for 16 or similar.
-> Or sieges. If you get sieged and you want to sally out, you will take atleast one turn of attrition even if you sally out right after getting sieged. AI can sally out next turn without taking that one round attrition which can mean like 500 soldiers.
Future of DLC´s
-> Honestly from what ive heard, it seems we are getting stupid Story packs and no factions for normal campaing. Story Packs and mini-campaing were bad idea back in WHI and CA seemed to take note from that but oh well ... it looks like they didnt",1562332292,1562332292,True,0.0,True,False,False,648,en

Despite being lacking in the battle department, it does have the best diplomacy system so far. I don't really know why anyone ever thought it was a good idea to take the trading of provinces out of diplomacy, but whoever that was should be fired. It's, for me, one of the biggest parts that makes diplomacy worthwhile as it allows a pacifistic expansionist playstyle. The battles aren't always all there though, mainly due to how the cavalry works. Cavalry charges have never been as strong as they are in this game, wherein you murder with mass rather than combat stats. This means that one of the strongest cavalry units (Virtuous noblemen) are easily outperformed by one of the weakest cavalry units (Yellow Turban Horsemen) because they have fewer models which makes their charge worse. Things like this, wherein the cost of units is irrelevant in regards to their effectiveness, is ridiculously stupid. 

Aside from that it's one of the worst rock-paper-scissors that the series has ever seen, on the presumption that you can actually brace your infantry versus their cavalry. Otherwise you'll see your spearmen be absolutely crumpled by their cavalry, which is an all-round unpleasant experience. Not one that I agree with either, seeing as 2 cavalry units can basically destroy and unit as they can surround it and charge at least one flank, almost instantaneously destroying it. 

AI's a bit of a letdown as per usual, although it isn't the worst AI that the series has ever seen (nor the best). It gives you plenty of room to abuse it, as per usual, but if you're not going for any particularly cheesy strategies it should mostly work just fine.

Big fan of most of the things that happen on the campaign map though. Everything from the reduced replenishment comparatively to especially Warhammer to the quite extensive building chain makes the campaign map a pleasant experience. 

It ain't Shogun, but then it ain't Rome on release either. A 7.8/10

So far the only thing that I have seen that I would say needs to be fixed quickly is the strength of certain commanders in the one on one duels. Cao Cao being the worst of these as he is marked as Equal to Guan Yu ( The God of War ) i will agree that Lu Bu is the strongest fighter but Guan Yu would be a close second and not on equal level with Cao Cao. I would say that Zhao Yun needs a little bump as well and just a few more that should be fixed but all around a very fun game with a lot of replay.

The combat feels a lot smoother than for example Total War: Warhammer II and the battlefield changes a lot during a battle, I've never had a battle where there were just two walls of armies clashing for the whole battle before one surrenders. Battles are easy to understand and play, but they can be harder to master if you want to play more strategic (which definitely pays off).

The campaign map and empire management is fun and there are many resources you have to pay attention to: the population of a commandery (province), happiness, food and of course gold to pay your armies, buildings and the characters in your court. It took me quite some time to figure out what all the buttons on the campaign UI do, but overall the UI is clean and easy to use.

My favourite part is the character system which feels a little bit like the character system in Crusader Kings II, but not as expanded and deep. Your characters can die of old age, can marry and get children which can then join your faction as generals or be used as administrators/spies. Two characters can work in harmony or disharmony together depending on their characteristics and they will hate or like each other depending on events and battle outcomes. I feel the depth of the character system in THREE KINGDOMS is perfect since more depth would possibly make it too time consuming or take the player away from the empire management and battles.

Overall very fun to play solo or play a campaign with a friend, the price is high but I feel like it is worth it!

Three kingdoms creates a great historical game set in a turbulent China in a another collapse of the Chinese imperial throne. Armies are larger then ever (and will break your computer without a good processor and GPU with three armys or more on the battlefield) and generlas are their famous selfs for the time period. The Characters new system of who they like and not like also berings a fresh new mecanic to reflect this new game of the franchise as a unique game seperated from the Total War: Warhammer engine it uses (or at least resembles).

But let's be honest, not everything can be great about a game. One of my bigger criticism is the randomness of events (or that no one know the conditions that they are started with). An exampel is Liu Bei's campaign, where some events, like the Zhao Yun event from Liu Bei, has a narrow time/turn restriction (according to what I have read) to about a 20 turn time frame which in Zhao Yun's case is that a battle is triggered (and something else that I diden't really get) which during the campagin I ran my neighbour had removed the enemy provinces and as the historical fanatic I am, I could not attack this character to follow history as my objective was to defend him. Another critique is that not many characters that were famous has their own uniqeness to them (some are Xu Huang, Jia Xu, Xun Yu, Diao Chan, Wei Yan, Cheng Pu, and Huang Gai (a really odd one that has not been included since he was one of the most prominant generals to Sun Jian/Sun Ce/ Sun Quan)) and that many randomly generated characters suddenly appear and characters that was historical dosen't appear (maybe randoms are good for another campagin that is not the offical Three Kingdoms like Ma Teng and Liu Biao). 

Most of the above is more the kind of historical fanatic part of me that complaines. But gamplay wise, the events is a big one due to their importence for several characters to appear. Another one that has impact is vassal spamming from Yuan Shao and Cao Cao when they reach Marqiue level (which Yuan Shao reaches very quickly!). According to updates they are fine tuning this though, but after the third and fourth time that my war has been invalidated due to Yuan Shao vassalizing my opponent, it's getting kind of annoying... 

Overall I still give the game a 9/10 for it being in one of my most beloved time periods (Dynasty Warriors has set it's mark in my heart) but also that the game got a start without bigger problems the likes of other games (looking at you Rome 2) and Total War's larger then ever armies that collide and fight until there is no more then 500 remaining out of the 2000-3000 that entered. This game is for Total War fans both new and old according to me and the strategy loving ones too.

Played almost all but one starting faction, on easy and havent lasted more than 200 turns, This game is neither historically accurate or enjoyable as a totally as a partial fiction as Three Kingdoms is portrayed as. By the time you can come close to building up your cities and armies the AI has already over built. So you end up struggling through four or so generations of your chosen faction only to be exterminated by some unrelated rep of an opposing  faction. Mind you this is on easy! Why would anyone enjoy losing at a game for $60?? The balancing act in your commandaries is tedious and down right unobtainable. However, the AI doesnt have to struggle with reserves and buildings etc. It just conquers and  betrays treaties and puts historically opposed factions together to annihilate  your faction. I youtubed  and otherwise read reddit and others on how to make this work in campaign mode. And some of the work arounds seemed like suggestions for games that should be in beta!! Seriously unbalanced if not incomplete game that crashes with regularity. I say save your money and Devs get back to work!!
I am back with over 200 hours of play. Cant recall how many start overs and reloads i've done trying to finish a campaign, and still not win or complete one. Still dont get how sworn enemies ally up with each other to beat down my faction. The game is based on losse historical writings, but CA has swayed so far from even following a thread of the history that it detracts from satisfaction and game value. Ther are some of us that play this historical game which includes offerings from other devs for the fascination of China's amazing history even if fictionalized. But this game runs rough-shod all over the historical thread and ruins it for me. The AI seems more interested in defeating the player than following even the most vague account of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. ON easy mind you i cant balance my cities long enough to generate food or capital to compete with the AI run factions. I feel that at this level even $60 games should offer some sense of fun, accomplishment, maybe even some success? Not this one, even after hours of play I am either too stupid or the game play is so imbalanced as to render it impossible to complete a campaign! I even resorted to Mods to maybe possibly give me an edge, nope. I have Lie Bei and Dong Shou joining together in a confederation of all things to wipe me out! What campaign i ask? The campaign to free China from tyranny (Dong  Shou for starts) and form some sort of Three Kingdoms or defeat the player at all costs? Allies come and go like changing clothes, earnings go from + to - in one turn. If the play of this game is so complex and intricate as to have a degree in computer science I would like my money back and not recommend this for beginning or even moderate players.

I find that the diplomacy, overall, is now a lot better than it used to be, more fluid and with a lot of options. The VI seems to act a lot more intelligently overall, though far from perfect, I find it makes much more logical decisions.

One of the absolute best parts is knowing EXACTLY how far off you are in an offer. No longer must you keep guessing if you can add more or not because they are ""Moderately likely"" to accept. It is always now ""Yes"" or ""No"" and it gives a value how far off you are. It also lets you search by options. Want a trade agreement? Click the tab for quick deals, click Trade Agreement and see who will agree, who 'might' agree (as in you need to offer things) and who won't agree no matter what. It makes finding those things far faster and easier.

I am not a huge fan of unit diversity. Factions are all nearly identical, with a few small differences making them unique. Generals now come in a color, and you can get all basic militia units from that commander, as well as advanced units of that color. So if you have a Strategist, you can get archers and trebs, but not advanced swordsmen. What is more, if a unit dies, it isn't destroyed but will come back in 2 turns (unless the army is destroyed) so no more constantly having to recruit those fodder units over and over again.",1562206895,1562206895,True,0.0,True,False,False,255,en

Ai is harder to abuse in Diplomacy than in previous games, and seem less prone to do stupid things in the battle mode. Still dumb at times in the campaign maps.

Armies now consist of up to 3 hero-like general units, each with 6 units under their command. General army traits only effect their 6 units, so you can specialize unit bonuses. When recruited or disbanded the units under the general's command comes with them, and maintains their experience level.

Battles behave pretty much the same as before both on the campaign map and on live battles. Generals can now engage in duels with other generals, winning/losing provide bonuses plus taking the losing general out of the battle. Live naval combat is not featured, and must be auto-resolved. Basic units animations have been simplified, they no longer have animated fights they simply swing at each other. Duels between generals are still animated.

Political/Family system that keeps track of character loyalties based on court positions, relationships and traits. High/Low Loyalty affects whether or not they're are willing to join another faction if captured or let go, and whether or not they stay in your service or rebel against you.

Research tree is now unlocked at a flat rate, except with Yellow turbans whom retain research buildings like in previous games.

Agents are no longer special units that move across the map like previously. Instead you assign idle generals/court nobles to assignments in settlements to perform the buffs that agents used to provide. 

Spy's also assign from idle general/court nobles to a target faction. Now however the spy enters the target factions ""Court"" and can be recruited by the target faction. Once recruited they can perform agent action based on the position given to them by the target faction, ranging from de-buffing them, instigating characters to betray or leave the faction and finally to taking over the faction.

Building is pretty much the same as previous games. 2-4 settlements per commandery, 1 city each plus specialized villages (ie. fishing village/farm/tea plantation/mines etc.).

Overall campaign story/pacing is based on the Heaven's mandate ranking mechanics, starting at nobles and ending with declaring yourself Emperor. The higher the ranking the more diplomatic options you have and the more the AI tend to like/dislike you depending on their personality. At King rank the three top powers declare themselves Emperor, and their emperor seats/capital must be held to maintain their claim as emperor. Conquering the 3 seats is the win condition. Big diplomatic de-buff between competing emperors, but other factions tend to be more receptive to joining a side.

The gameplay is addicting and captivating to strategy game fans that makes you say ""One more turn before bed"" to yourself constantly. One of the very first video game I touched was Starcraft 2 back in 2010, so I really enjoy the fact that there are real time combat in a turn based strategy game, it feels refreshing after playing SC2 for years and hundreds hours of Civilization.

I also really really enjoy the music, there are not many tracks which is a downside, but I absolutely love how they did the music. Here is one of my favorite piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MYAzRwrscQ The music make use of several ancient Chinese instrument and weaves them together into a beautiful masterpiece.

The overall visual is very beautiful to look at, not stunning, but really easy on the eyes, the campaign map of China uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers, land and trees, not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at, there are also peasants working on the fields, soldiers patrolling the main road,  pandas eating bamboos, and hunters hunting wild animals. making the entire map feel alive, small details goes a long way.

Now let me talk about something I feel is lacking about this game:

First off, the multiplayer is somewhat lacking, when I play a co-op match, even after I signed the shared victory treaty I still can't reinforce my partner's army, I have to wait till I rank up to form a coalition to be able to do so, doing so makes the fact that the first half of a co-op game is just minding their own business, it's worse that sometimes you won't be able to see each other for a good 50 turns if you pick two factions that have distant starting locations.

Also, the community manager is really full of herself, at least on reddit which is the platform I use, yes, Grace, I'm talking about you, what kind of community manager would threaten a community that they will not respond anymore if users post threads they don't like? This caused a massive drama on the subreddit and I feel it is very unprofessional for a community manager to do so.

Overall, I'm absolutely having a blast with this game, and I can't wait to clock more hours into this both by myself and with friends that I have some co-op campaigns going on with.",1562191193,1562191193,True,0.5726495981216431,False,False,False,463,en

With Three Kingdoms acting as the new installment to the franchise, I certainly was stoked to play this game as it reminded me of my conquest to become Shogun in Japan. Playing this game since release and grinded it for a good two weeks or so, it has become one of my favorite Total War Games, on par with Shogun 2 – I think because it reminds me so much of Shogun 2 as several A.I factions try to reach the same end goal as you. In a way, Three Kingdoms is basically Shogun 2, but based in China with improved game-play mechanics and what seems to be a bigger map (no surprise there). 

One of my favorite things about Three Kingdoms is the option in what game-play you’d like – Romance or Records mode, which is basically asking if you want to play Three Kingdoms to be more like the Warhammer series (Romance) or the traditional Total War mode (Records). Watching characters duel it out on the battlefield and all (despite the repetitive animations) is fascinating to watch and can help change the tide of the battle if you win, which I though was cool. Changing the settings to make everything in the game speak in Mandarin makes this game even more immersive and interesting compared to leaving it in English. Graphics wise, although looks decent, it didn’t look as great as other installments. Some may say it looks cartoon-ish, which is quite true. 

Although there has been good strides to improve from some of the day one bugs (i.e. tweaks in diplomacy mechanics by factions), looking at the game there are still some issues to address regarding the stability of the game. Despite patches made to fix some of the causes of game crashes, I still face the occasional crash once in awhile when entering a battle, but rarely do I face this problem.

Despite it all, Total War Three Kingdoms is game that shows CA took some beloved mechanics of previous installments and improved upon them with new game-play features in a unique setting, making Three Kingdoms an enjoyable experience for those looking to vie control over all of China.

First and main comment needed to be said: This is my favorite total war game yet (I have played most of them, some of which not on this account). For the most part it is very polished and I have had very little issues since I started playing this. The gameplay took most of the best features from past games and adapted them into one game.
If you liked any other total war game you'll probably love this one. If you've never tried total war, try this one, it's really that simple.

The few complaints I have heard on the forums anger me because people are dumb. The main on is that the game lacks unit diversity, and to be fair, there are a limited number of unit types compared to games like total war warhammer. But that is not a fair comparison, because this is ancient china, and back then most of the technology was the same and so it would make no sense to have each faction radically different from each other. On top of that, being able to look at an enemy army and know roughly how good they are just by the fact that most factions use similar units, you don't need to play as all the factions to know if its a good match up or not.

Most of the negative ideas I have on this game stem from the learning curve honestly. Some things within the game are hard to understand until you make several mistakes (such as army composition). You have to get some experience with the game to really enjoy it to it's fullest. I started loving the game on my second campaign, and by the third one I knew enough about the map and the units to take full advantage of all the diplomacy options and strategic locations on the map.

In the end the game is fantastic, and I urge people to give it a shot. If you are unsure, watch some let's plays of it to get a better feel for the game, it does help.",1562153023,1562153023,True,0.0,True,False,False,363,en

China is big and full of diversity, also I hope they add the Nanman down south for a DLC, because right now its just an empty waste land, I would really love to see Meng Huo and Zhu Rong.

The Total War franchise since the beginning has smelted that need to conquer into a smooth, cohesive experience. From Medieval times to the Three Kingdoms era, the formula has not really changed, and I love it. You take cities, accrue wealth, and build your armies for war.
In this latest iteration of Total War, you play as various factions of the Three Kingdoms era, a time where war was waged purely for the pursuit of unification and power. Take the field as the legendary Cao Cao or Liu Bei, and watch as your generals duel enemies on the field of battle. It may take time, but as you play, you slowly begin eating up other factions or vassalizing them.
Use diplomacy or strategy to slowly take over your enemies, but you have to be careful. If you make too many enemies, you may find yourself surrounded with not enough resources to battle everyone. Making smart choices with alliances or non-aggression pacts are the key to overcoming all obstacles. That being said, I had a really good time with the game but it did make me miss actual diplomacy trees, and not just the simplified version that Total War includes. I wish there was more to the game past the blind raging warfare that you wage, but that's not what this game is. Total War Three Kingdoms is a game that allows for players to strategically take their opponents down while dabbling in basic diplomatic skills. 
The game did crash every so often, but I can't tell if it was my PC just shutting the program down or if it was the client. Thankfully, auto-saving happens, and I never lost much progress.

Economy: 
AI always has a lot of  armies more he can effort from his income. 
He is building infrastructure faster then you,  
Military campaign: 
Ai always knows positions of your armies 
Battles on river must be delegated so it is no matter how smart you are, if AI calculate he wins your army is gone. For me this is big minus. You can lose in critical point of campaign. 
I can´t see supply bar on enemy armies, so I can`t plan to attack them when they are weakened. Instead I observe them running thru my territory without losing supply. 
Defending of small cities (type: lumber mill, fishing port, mine, farms etc. )  is a joke. Garrison you get with upgrading is for nothing. They ran in panic like herd of goats even thou they are winning battle. Like they are program to lose. And captain is first to run. Of course putting extra army to support them helps a lot but you are not in stand to protect everything. 
Battle:
OMG, everything locks the same. Constantly pressing space bar to see if it is my unit or not. 
cavalry is overpowered. AI archers, somehow, have more arrows then yours. 

After playing Warhammer 2 this game is terrible downgrade.

This iteration made a few steps forward while taking a few steps back. The army re-design for it's functionality of a specialized general with then his own retinue of troops through that focus was a great design balancing the number of 'Hero' characters within an army and the ability have focused distribution of troops that make each army a bit more unique and less templated in design. This is honestly a change I feel would've been a solid feature throughout the franchise. The lack of the traditional Officer/Spy/Diplomat roles as heroes adds some challenges when it comes to intelligence gathering on the world map but is something that can be compensated for.

The world feels large and expansive but the starting factions primarily begin in the Northern part of the terrain, selecting a faction that starts more southerly makes it easier to rapidly expand and take over territory which feels a bit wonky overall but the map is highly detailed and well designed. The overall feeling of the commandaries (provinces) have very much the same feel as their counterparts from Empire Total War.

The most significant downfall in the design is the new tech tree, which 'tech tree' was taken literally by overlaying the technological research on a graphic for a tree. At first glance this is chaotic and difficult to read to accomplish any specific goal you're looking after. Having standard (non-militia), elite (high end soldiers), and sub-standard (peasantry) troops on the research tree was an interesting choice but ultimately feels pretty good for how to unlock these rather than gating them behind structures as the traditional total war system works. The chaotic network of this tree still remains a frustrating experience to look at and may have been better represented with scrolls or along the lines of how faction research trees were in both the Warhammer Total War games. 

Romance vs Records modes for the gameplay was a interesting addition that I greatly appreciated and the dueling mechanics as seen in the Romance version would be a good addition to the Total War series of games but don't fit much else in the franchise. It is an amazing addition to the title for Three Kingdoms and out of the stand alone features that are immensely impressive.

Every time a new total war comes out like all fans of the series I am hopeful it will be an improvement from the last. This is not... while the game is different it feels unfinished. The troops don't have individual fights like the ones that make the battles more immersive when panning across the battle fields from Medieval 2 thru Warhammer. The generals dueling is a cool feature but still feels unfinished. I have had generals who were far stronger than their opponent lose for reasons beyond me. Leading to his regiment retreating and soon after army losses and battle lost. Army losses in my opinion is ruining my total war experience, from units retreating from the field without even seeing the enemy to castle/town defenses breaking because the of city damage. There is no more inspiring speeches from the leaders of your faction and glorious last stands defending a castle until the very last man. When I purchased this game I was hoping for intense battles with massive armies deciding the fate of either faction. The battles now are like skirmishes compared to those of later titles. Two full stack armies fielding thousands of troops are turned to corpses in a matter of 15 minutes. Castle walls are brought down with two or three shots from a trebuchet or gates destroyed with a couple hits from a battering ram. The battles feel like an after thought and 100% of the focus was put into making a pretty game with new diplomacy which renamed defensive alliance and call it a coalition and allows you to buy gold with gold. While this game had the opportunity to be something amazing it just isn't. It's unfinished and even after DLC it still won't be a complete game unless the modding community does what they do best and complete what CA and Sega threw at us so we could give them more money. It's such a shame that I struggled to get over 80 hours out of something that I thought I would have endless fun with. Sorry for the rant I'm just tired of unfinished products for full price and being left disappointed and going back to the good total wars i.e. Rome, Medieval 2, Shogun 2, and after many updates Rome 2. Empire and Napoleon are playable with mods.",1562084158,1562084158,False,0.523809552192688,True,False,False,409,en

I don't write reviews often but this game needs it, this is by far one of the best Total Wars thus far and there are plenty of good things to say about it. The battles are fast paced, challenging and above all fun to play. The campaign is entertaining on a beautiful landscape with intrigue and drama, plus I've always loved a good sense of well made mechanics which these are. Each faction carries their own means of advancing, infamy, power gathering or whatever, it provides a lot of different play styles.

In short, this game can provide new things to the Total War veterans as well as the newcomers, a game I definitely would advise people to pick up and play. A strategy game that has earned some respect from myself. :)",1562083816,1562083816,True,0.0,True,False,False,137,en

i have only played romance mode so cannot attest to the records mode but i found the combat to be average nothing special but nothing terrible. Trebs and archers with a decent front line will win you most battles with the ai occasionly pulling a fast one not often but it can happen. I would like a larger weapon variety (some weapons like sai etc) for the commanders in romance mode maybe?

The only other games that I would be interested in playing from this franchise are the ""Shogun"" games. I cannot really speak to how much this game is better/worse than previous historical ""Total War"" games (I enjoy both TW: Three Kingdoms"" and ""TW: Warhammer""). 

That being said, I am also a huge fan of Chinese culture, literature, philosophy etc. Speaking from that point of view, the aesthetic, the adaptation of the original stories to this game, all of this is done incredibly well. The music, the artwork, the campaign map, everything looks amazing and I think does justice to the source material and Chinese culture. 

In terms of game play, although there are a few weaknesses to the game, overall ""TW: Three Kingdoms"" is a very well done strategy game. Here are some of the strengths and general points that the game could improve upon. 

Strengths: 
* The diplomacy in this game is probably the most well done out there of any strategy, 4X, RTS, etc. game - period. 
* The economy management/building we also very well done. It is not too complicated but there can be a bit of a learning curve. 
* The heroes, your generals, and the mechanics for keeping them happy and getting the most out of them/assigning them positions/making them stronger warriors or leaders, all super well done as well. 

Weaknesses: 
* There is a bit of a shortage of unit type/diversity. I imagine some more will eventually be added with DLC but generally you do have a limited set of possibly units to recruit and most of your opponents will have access to exactly the same set. 
* The AI, even on Legendary difficulty, is not too smart. I feel like this is the case with most strategy/RTS/4X games but ""TW: Three Kingdoms"" is not as bad as the others (which is why I am here!). 
* The current map of China is still quite a bit empty in the south west and south east, plus a bit up north. These will for sure be filled up with DLC and those who know the stories can already guess a bit as to what might come. With these vacant spots, a few of the factions that start in the south become a bit too dominant in every game.
* I assume all of these weaknesses will be remedied with the addition of DLC in the future. 

All is all, this is an incredibly enjoyable game. Considering the weaknesses, there is much more replay-ability than you might expect at first. Looking forward to the DLC! Very well done account of the fantastic novels!",1562077583,1562077583,True,0.0,True,False,False,460,en

Obviously the best part about TW strategy games is the combination of round based campaign movement/decisions and follow up real time battles whenever you confront an army/settlement! Done especially nice by adding unique mechanics for the different playable warlords. 

Aside from that the other two main components are to manage settlemments and relations to other npc nations... both fall a bit flat because settlements are streamlined to be easier accessable for new players and diplomacy still needs polish, right now it's way too easy to trade territory for items etc.

The plus side:
+ Good gameplay (both on map and in battle)
+ Good launch (The game worked without too much software flaws on the first day)
+ History (If you like the Three Kingdoms era)
+ Ok AI (They're not too stupid, although at times I question their logic sanity)
+ Plenty of diplomacy choices.
+ You can manage your generals in term of skills and items 
+ Good graphics

The minus side:
- Not enough original portraits 
- Some more important characters doesn't have original portrait either)
- Personally, I would've like some more skills in the game
- The lack of daughters (I've got too many sons... they don't love daddy)

Although it certainly has a few flaws, the game itself is pretty well made and largely bug free on release. 

The campaign is the certainly the area that has undergone the most improvement, with its newly deigned character management system and expanded diplomacy options. They have also finally added the family tree back in to the game which allows your leader to produce children who can be married to characters from other factions. While economy/settlement management is fairly decent and does require a bit of understanding to get right, can become a little to simplistic and easy to game once you understand it.

The battles are also fairly good although there is a distinct lack of variety compared to TW Warhammer, which is understandable given that this game is based on a civil war within a single nation. But even from the early to late game, most armies will look relatively similar with a very clear ""best"" army format that will become apparent once the campaign and all of your armies will gravitate towards this unless you're specifically trying to be experimental. Which means that most battles will play out in a very similar way.

Most of my experience comes from Warhammer 2 and to be honest that game doesn't even measure up to this when it comes to depth.

The battles are great, with lots of formation options later on in the game to add those extra tactical layers. Sieges are amazing, attacking settlements is great, and so is defending them. 
The only real issues I have with this game are the lack of unit variety and a lack of depth. I did say that this game has more depth than warhammer 2 but honestly I just want much more depth, but that would make the barrier of entry way too high.

Speaking of which, the barrier of entry is quite low in my opinion. If you're new to total war I suggest picking this game up since it's more similar to most total war titles than the warhammer ones. Just pick Cao Cao and let the advisor guide you and you'll be fine.

As The Tiger Sun Jian approached his ally Lu Bu's siege of his former master's capital to steal the Emperor with the aid of our fellow member Yuan Shu he knew the Mandate of Heaven was to be passed from Han hands that very day, he knew the entire fate of China was to be forever changed within the coming hours. When The Dark Moon Coalition turned to see The Tiger climbing down the mountain paths they expected to unleash the beast upon the city but instead as they turned their backs the Tiger pounced. The Flying General lay dead in the gorge along with his unprepared armies and the pitiful fool Yuan Shu fled for his life. Sun Jian was only securing his meal though, the true prize... The Eternal Empire. 

Sun Jian pillaged the city until every valuable scrap was torn from it's bones, the Han emperor in his grasp, and his son Sun Quan and daughter Sun Ce amassing their own individual armies in the homeland, and a new secret alliance between the Ma through the marriage of Ma Chao and Sun Ce obtaining another superior commander... Sun Jian was about to forge a dynasty to unite China forever. Sun Jian however will never see that eternal empire, nor would he ever see his home again. Sun Ce with her husband Ma Chao marched north upon Yuan Shu, destroying every piece of evidence of his existence expect for one. Sun Ce. Sun Ce sided with his father in law Yuan Shu. After being defeated by his own mother and father  in the same mountain pass they watched Lu Bu and his forced get obliterated he remained loyal to his emperor preferring death over betrayal. Sun Jian unable to kill his own son, released him. Sun Ce spent the rest of his life in self-exile. Sun Jian spent the next 15 years within the western mountains fighting onslaught after onslaught of resistance, most notably in the Luoyang Trading Post where a garrison of just over 300 soldiers held against an army of over 2,000 slaying more than half of them. As they were preparing for one last battle before obvious death Sun Jian rescued them, his wife Lady Wu paying the ultimate sacrifice. After 15 years of endless fighting and bloodshed Sun Jian finally passed due to natural causes.

As Sun Ren marched her father's empire into war against his former allies none challenged her authority, not even Sun Quan her older brother. Sun Ren was named heir after Sun Ce remained loyal to his father in law, Sun Quan knowing his sister's abilities did not resist her authority. She would lead the empire into another 12 years of fighting before every last enemy had been subdued and every rebel slain. Sun Ren would sit upon the throne of an empire her father forged but never saw, and empire he paid with his life for, an empire of The Rising Sun, The Eternal Empire of Wu. Over 40 years of endless bloodshed finally quenched through the might of Sun Ren.

So yeah that's just a very brief believe it or not description of my experience in this game. By the end of it I finished the campaign at 66 hrs and it was 100% worth it. Waiting for friends to get the game so I can try campaigning with them. Think I've successfully indoctrinated into the Total War cult.",1562038577,1562038577,True,0.0,True,False,False,657,en

Its evolved into a very character driven franchise.. you feel as if you're watching relationships play out between characters instead of just waging war as a faction. Its hard to explain until you play it but you'll find yourself thinking more about the characters and how they interact with and feel towards each other than just planning your next moves to paint the world map.

The diplomacy is a big step forward as well. You can make almost every request of the AI you can think of while also understanding why they accept your negotiation or not.

Compared to prior titles, some aspects have been ramped up, while other fell short, while some went in the completely wrong direction. As an avid Total War fan, I rarely write reviews but I just came across an event in my campaign that I felt needed sharing. 

Pros:
-The map is dynamic and colorful. Graphic formula is typical of Total War games, got a bit of an upgrade.
-Resource management is done well with every commanderie having one or two villages attached to it that give you an idea of where to start building a resource base.
-Family tree made it back finally, you become somewhat invested in your main characters.
-Combat is flushed out pretty well.
-Diplomacy works well, you can easily identify trends in shifting alliances as time goes on. Keeps you engaged in the campaign.
-The rivals and friends system is neat as your characters develop relationships. Immerses you in the campaign.

Cons:
-After a while, you have some many generals, family members, staff, etc. they are just a place holder. You eventually lose sight of them in a sea of characters.
-The concept of character gear and gear sets is cool, but it needs more attention. It gets a little diluded as to what good builds are. Some stats are on some gear that makes no sense. Like why would a gear item have stats for attack, defense, etc. and also have something that boosts income for a governed commanderie. Why the hell would that gear be like that?
-The computer doesn't play by the same rules of rational diplomacy as you. While the concept of vassalization, coalitions, etc. works well. The computer is able to travel in your lands as vassals. In my campaign, I had a vassal, park an army outside a city in the middle of my empire, declare independence, attack my city, and take it. Wtf......? Is that honestly how it was meant to be? CA, you have got to be kidding me, are you out of your minds? I wish to God I was at the meeting that determined that be a suitable action.  If that's the case, no one should ever enter into any partnership with any faction. (Event caused my writing a review)
-Spies is a cool concept, but the juice is not worth the squeeze. Most of the actions they can perform have little to no effect. Plus, they eventually grow more attached to their false leader and you gotta pull em back or lose them because they defect. That system needs a rework.

Overall, very recommended. Worth the money.",1562019209,1562019209,True,0.0,True,False,False,451,en

The Warhammer fantasy incarnations have been fantastic, Brittania - less so, though it had some interesting new mechanics. CA seem to have taken lots from all the feedback of everything so far and added a stackload more.

Initially, the volume of depth in so many different fields may be a little overwhelming, but stick with it. 

***READ THE TOOLTIPS***

The overlay is available on every screen you come across. It it well worth taking the time to read through things to expand your understanding. Some people have said they've just not bothered with the odd element, but they are seriously missing out.

The diplomacy/relational system will keep you on the edge of your seat each turn. As with the spy networks, and the threat of them. Just where does the loyalty of your new generals lie....

Highly recommended for fans of the series. If you arrived with the Warhammer series, use the Romance Mode for characters with extra powers.
If you prefer historical accuracy, stick with Records Mode, for more realistic stuff.

For immersion, you've gotta go with spoken Chinese and subtitles. 

And whenever you get chance, zoom in on the battlefields to see phenomenal animations - especially when characters are duelling.

when you getting the hang of it its quite easy to control your units to move around and do what you want them to do.

only bad thing i have to say so far is that its totally unacceptable that you need to pay for having blood in the game.. 
that blood and gore is hidden behind a paywall is a scummy move in a war game imho.

Three Kingdoms is a quite competent Total War game. As far the historic ones go I'd argue it's the best, on-par with Shogun II post-expansions, if lighter on content since it's still new. It has interesting unique systems like recruits being dependent on general type, far better diplomacy, spying. It allows you to pick whether you want a more Dynasty Warriors style ""romance"" or a more Total War ""records"" mode. It has characters from the lore, if you're into the Three Kingdoms era. Its combat mechanics have some neat twists, including a surprisingly real scarcity of money and hence a focus on cheap mass over sparse substance (other than the army-slaughtering generals in records mode).

Recommended! It's not perfect, of course. Options could be better, performance could be better, asking 3€ for the blood-effects DLC is just silly, the ""introduction"" character is actually one of the hardest to play. But it's well-balanced all in all, a load of fun, shows a battlefield rarely seen by most of us in the western world and brings in a handful of fresh ideas.",1562014373,1562014373,True,0.0,True,False,False,207,en

It comes with a well optimised engine that doesn't seem to struggle as much as Warhammer 2 or Rome 2, and the UI looks great(though unit portraits in both their renditions are a bit lacking) 

This doesn't however come without some drawbacks. Diplomacy feels great, but with the setting being one of the most backstab-happy periods of time, you often feel yourself forced into conflicts you'd rather avoid, as even your most ardent allies can betray you at the drop of a hat - it adds some actual emotional impact when your ol' pal Liu Bei stabs you in the back after 70 turns of an alliance just because you decided to help him win a war on the other side of the map, leaving yourself exposed, but it often feels arbitrary and punishing, with the AI often seemingly gaming the rules. Allies declare war on your vassals, forcing you to either break alliance with them and suffer diplomatic penalties or abandon a vassal, suffering diplomatic penalties. You're often punished for not following TW's usual strategy of kill and expand everyone and everywhere despite it seemingly being one of the biggest features of 3K.

Character interactions are a great bit of fun, but they too struggle with being rather surface level compared to what they could be - family mechanics from historical TWs make a return, but with the added expansion of character politics they feel very limiting as they only concern the ruling family - your loyal servants, now with personalities and significantly expanded roles now feel static as you cannot affect their interpersonal relations beside allowing friendships - you cannot marry them off and hope that their offsprings will continue their family line without adopting them into the ruling family, which turns your family tree into something more akin to an average CK2 seducer run.

On a more nitpicky note, I also wish the number of officers with unique portraits would be expanded up - as it is, there's only a handful of unique characters during the late game, which can make diplomacy and character management hard to keep track of when everyone looks the same. Even a few more unique armours for the generic officers would alleviate this.

Overall, I definitely had fun with 3K and will definitely continue to do so - I hope that future DLCs expand upon the roster and add some stability to the diplomacy system, however ahistorical it might be.

Buggy?  Yes, but its a Total War title.  But on that same coin, it is the least buggy Total War game launch that I have ever seen.  
Fun?  Absofreakinloutley.  Lu Bu holding a flank by himself with 240 Spearmen.  He killed 2200 of them, spearmen killed 500.  I think that sounds about right.
Music?  Excellent!  Still not as good as the original Rome Total War.  But great in its own right.
Memorable?  Surprisingly yes, you get attached to all your characters as they level up and I found more time being spent with them customizing them than in the battles.
Battles?  Weakest part of this whole game in my opinion.  Compared to prior installments it.... it just feels like its missing variety.  Everyone gets the same kind of units except the Yellow Turbans which, they are broken.  Their Generals.... I cleared a garrison and the Generals defending it with just the 3 generals.  10/10 Would kill 3000 people again with only 3 guys.

Heres good things
Battles, and over all sieges are fun now the unit variety is so much. The way how they implemented heroes was also so good. Only heroes that were the underdogs were the Authority heroes.

But the campaign is just mess. The AI makes the game very unbearable. If you are stronger than every they will bow down to you view you as god or if you show any sort of weakness which is very normal in the early game, usually the half map will declare war on you if just lose half your army on settlement siege even the ones you aggression pacts or trade agreements.

The end game becomes an boring grind if the other Emperor Seats spawn in to far corner of the maps which happened to me three times in a row.

The AI seems to be very braindead specially in end game where it just idles, while in early game it is at it's most aggressive.

To add up the end game micro management is just pure hell asnd some times it might take 5-10 minutes just to check every building or army per turn which is horrible.

To finalize this game needs more polishing and overhauling which is sad because it seems it was left unfinished on purpose just to ''sell the extra DLC.''

I have had Three Kingdoms now for about a week and I already have almost 90 hours on the game. It stays true to previous games in the franchise while adding new concepts to spice up traditional gameplay. You can play the game in either a classic mode with traditional generals/bodyguards; or you can mix it up a romantic mode which converts generals into larger than life heroes on the battlefield. All this combined with a more stable diplomacy system and spy networks that can be created to infiltrate enemy factions rather than just looking into a single town's garrison make this one stand out from the rest.
  I am a veteran to the series from the original Rome TW days and grew up with these classic strategy games. Prior to this game the best made of the newer titles was shogun 2. However, I truly believe this game takes the cake, by combining classic total war feels (aka long grueling campaigns that take time and effort to win), along with the simplicity and beauty of shogun 2, and finally knocks this title out of the part with the addition of the romantic mode that really gives this game the feel of playing out the history of the 3 kingdoms time period in China.",1561982758,1561982758,True,0.52173912525177,True,False,False,232,en

Thankfully the game is so good that I've begun to watch the Three Kingdoms show and read the book. 

At its core it's a Total War game, so if you've played any of the recent titles you'll know what to expect. The biggest addition is the Romance mode, which turns it into a dramatic show/movie, with generals duelling in the middle of huge battles. This also means you get attached to generals and get genuinely annoyed and sad when they die, like XCOM.

I'm absolutely hooked on this game and can't praise it enough.

PRO
+ great grapics
+ wonderful soundtrack/ music
+ new setting
+ (rng) events tell a great story
+ character relations
+ new spy system

CONTRA
- annoying late game
- not a lot of unit diversity
- 'random war declarations' (like I'm way up north and a southern small lord declares war on me)
- trait gain seems kinda random, and can really hurt the character relations
- spy system is rather... random I suppose

-The campaign map is easily the most in depth total war campaign map I ever played. 
-Great graphics
- Best diplomacy of any total war game diplomacy
- Fantastic job at emulating the feel of the romance of the three kingdoms
Negative
- Units feel the same regardless of factions
- No tech tree. Instead you unlock a reform every 5 turns. Not a bad system, just not one I prefer
- New UI that differs from other Total war game. Which isn't bad. You just have to get use to it.

Game is greatly optimised.  Running the game around 80 to 120 fps on everything on ultra apart from shadows.  Even unit size is set to extreme. And the game runs better than any recent total war game.

Battle are fun and balanced and AI  does offer a better challenge compared to previous total war games. Especially on higher difficulties where the AI tend to play smarter.  Heroes are great fun and makes battles more enjoyable. 

This game has the best diplomacy to date for a total war game.  Far more options than before, and you can do a lot more. Which add's another layer to the game, and makes things more interesting and dynamic. 

Graphics - The game looks studding, the campaign and battle map look fantastic and really bring China to life. I will have to say that in my opinion, the character models are lacking compared to previous total war games though. Might just be me on that.

Glad to see them moving in that direction, and also the change over to have 3 generals vs 1 in a full stack is welcome. Having to manage their relationships makes it more difficult to make min-maxed armies, forcing you to make do and experiment with different setups (it keeps the game more fresh if you cannot simply make copy-pastes of same ideal army set-ups). Ie: you can't find enough semi-loyal green champions, forcing you to experiment with purple sentinels. 

 Performance also seems somewhat better than previous historic titles. AI actually acts different based on battle difficulty, diplomacy is much less of a headache thanks to quick-deal and make-this-work (seriously would kill for that in a game with a crazy amount of factions like Attila/Rome 2/Empire)

Originally I was really opposed to the lack of naval battles, but given the map as it is currently I have not had naval encounters in my zheng jiang and cao cao campaigns. Hopefully we can see some form of island battles come to this if not a full on naval expansion dlc as some have theorized.

The game has a lot of depth, runs well and is enjoyable all around. Diplomacy was improved compared to previous Total War games. There's a pretty robust system now with a lot of options, enabling you to know exactly what you need to offer in order to make a deal go through. Another nice thing about the game is that it has a great RPG system where characters level up, learn new traits and become stronger over time. You can also outfit them with different pieces of equipment. This comes to the fore most in Romance mode, where officer units are a force all on their own, and if left unchecked, can potentially pull off Dynasty Warriors levels of obliterating soldiers. This doesn't mean I think they are broken though (or at least not to the point of making the game too imbalanced), as there are several ways to check them.

Battles run well and the battlefields look beautiful. There's a lot of attention to historical detail, even if not everything is perfect. Additionally, Creative Assembly solicited advice from renowned Late-Han historian Dr. Rafe de Crespigny when producing this game. I greatly respect them for that, as Dr. Rafe de Crespigny is the preeminent English writing scholar in the field. 

There's a lot of other things I could praise about the game too. For example, I love the soundtrack and the plethora of different events that can pop up in a game as a consequence of faction specific missions or character traits. 

Every game has a few flaws, so I feel that for the sake of fairness I should point out what I feel is flawed about 3k Total War. #1 is that the battles do not change much from beginning to end game, and do not change much depending on which faction you play. You will largely be doing the same thing to win battles from beginning to end, and regardless of who you choose to play. Secondly, the South of the campaign map is totally devoid of competition. This allows you to steamroll the region as a player, if prioritized, or will enable Sun Jian as the AI to steamroll it instead. There are also some kinks with vassalization and diplomacy. Sometimes diplomatic deals can be reneged on without consequence as a result of either the player or the AI exploiting loopholes, especially pertaining to vassalization. These flaws do not detract from the overall experience, but I do think that the late game can become a bit tedious. Nonetheless, I've put in countless hours of the game and still enjoy it a lot. I would recommend it to people interested in this time period.",1561957001,1561957001,True,0.5273631811141968,True,False,False,461,en

I have since played Warhammer one and two, so its similar enough that players from those two entries will be right at home here. Personally i feel like the campaign is a much better time in this entry, because of the way buildings are explained to you. Right clicking a building or character no longer sends you to a web page within the game (looking at you Warhammer) and instead opens an information panel. Useful!

However, i DO miss some of the unit variety of the Warhammer games. There are no dragons, no monsters, nothing super brutal or scary. All factions play essentially the same in battles with only minor playstyle differences in the early game, or having a harder start on the campaign map

The diplomatical system in this game and with the spy mechanic is just fun to test out. Best part for me was when I became a vassal of a bigger empire just to betray it later on. I can't say it's the best total war game because for me it's warhammer 2, who got that spot but this game isn't far of. 

This is the bad stuff I think of the game. Total War: Three Kingdoms replayability is very low sadly. Everything feels like none of the different coalition factions are any special from each others. You basically get 2 new units and one unique building type. The problem is even with the bonus your faction leader gives you, it won't last forever but that's fine for me. The part I'm concerned about is the variations of units and that the end game feels all the same for me. You can literally get any faction leader in the game on your side to be in your faction.

Anyway I wanted to end it by saying this game isn't the perfect total war game for me. I do still recommend it despite the lack of replayability. I think when we get mods coming out this will be an amazing game again. I hope this helped a bit have a great day everyone!

The new tech makes things a little bit weird now there is no boosting tech to try and get a leg up everyone gets new tech every 5 turns which did take a style of gameplay and just eliminated it. A nice change is diplomacy is still CA, but with a twist certain faction/leaders have personality's explaining why they will be a peace with you walk a full army to a unguarded town then next turn declare war, Still dumb but at least it gives a reason. Not a huge fan of the RNG of the campaign on which story book characters actually join you instead of guaranteed I understand their reason but not a fan. Though when mods are supported fully in the next few patches im sure it will be fixable. Another strange choice on CA is when the faction leader dies old age battle what ever the entire faction's name will change and it can make things really confusing around mid to late game where no one is the original people and then they just become generic slog. 
Also a big plus for me is the option to go back and forth between Realism/Records aka your generals have body guards just like in nonfiction game series or Fantasy/Romance where your hero's are overpowered 1 man vs 100

Gráficos: Provavelmente o melhor de todos os Total War até o momento, muitas opções, e tem uma performance a par com Warhammer 2.

Som: Nada a reclamar, como todos TW, esse aspecto técnico é sublime.

Jogabilidade: Novas funções adicionadas a campanha, fornecendo até então a campanha mais versátil e provavelmente com melhor repetitividade. 

Minha critica principal ao jogo é no âmbito das batalhas, apesar de serem muito bonitas a distância, as animações individuais são pouco variadas, vem na contra mão de Shogun 2 que foi lançado em 2011 e até hoje pra mim possui as melhores animações.

Pra finalizar novamente a SEGA fatia o jogo em pedaços, primeiro você compra o básico, depois você precisa pagar mais pra ter blood and gore, o que é basicamente uma opção no menu de gráficos que custa quase 11 reais.

 The game sports two campaign game modes, Records and Romance; the historical mode and the more fantasy influenced mode respectively. Records puts an emphasis on unit fatigue in battle and planning your tactics more carefully. Generals are placed in a bodyguard unit as with previous historical titles. Romance mode follows more closely to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms epic and puts more focus into larger than life characters which fight alone as hero units similar to Warhammer. Romance mode allows for a cool duel mechanic between your own generals and the enemy's which can be a really fun thing to watch. Characters are allowed to possess weapons, armor, horses, and auxiliary attachments; and have skill trees and combat abilities, like in Warhammer. Each faction has unique mechanics, units, and buildings that add to the replayability factor.

   I imagine this will be the game that brings back fans that have been waiting for a mainline history focused game since the Warhammer games released.

I've known about the Total War games for years but I wasn't very interested in them. Until this game, this gem, this sweetfucking gold mine of a game popped up in my youtube recommendations list, and I watched the video, And I was impressed and have decided to give it a chance. And i'm so happy I did, because this game is such a pure masterpiece!

The reason I only have 80 hours invested in the game as of right now, is because I was watching CO OP campaigns for enjoyment and understanding the game's mechanics.

I was a total newbie in the Total War franchise and once I started this game, it took me about 30 to 40 hours to understand it all, with proper guides with proper explanations. And I'm stoked now that I am familiar with its mechanics and now I can play at my leisure.  It is so rewarding once you completely understand everything about the game.

Now let's go over the pros and cons shall we?

Pros: 

- Gameplay:
Amazing gameplay that combines both RTS and TBS elements, where you roam the map in the turn-based-strategy mechanics, conquering nations, making agreements and pacts, trading, forming coalitions, vassalziing nations and bind them to your will or annexing them outright and making their territories, characters and resources yours. The possibilities are LIMITLESS!

The combat featured in this game is presented through real-time-strategy where you have to control your units and to annihilate your enemies, or simply break their morale and make them run for their lives. You can also capture the enemy's generals and either employ them to your faction, ransom them for cold hard cash or execute them for ancillaries.
There are alot of varied units with different stats and animations,  Granted, from my understanding, some of the previous Total War games had more variety in terms of units, but i'd still give TWTK 8/10 in account of units variety!

- Diplomacy: 
I haven't played the previous Total War games, but from reading online, reviewers are saying that this game's diplomacy is the best! Which I also agreed, I think there's many options and it is very complex but once you understand it, it's fantastic. As I've stated above, you can do many many things on the diplomacy screen which looks very sophisticated and neat!

- Campaign: 
the greatest strength of TWTK is its campaign mode. Which combines all the features i've mentioned earlier. Every campaign is different even if you pick the same warlord, and you can choose from 12 very different factions (15 with the Yellow Turban Rebellion DLC). Furthermore, your characters realistically can die from old age through the campaign and you can choose heir, and marrying characters from your faction to further the dynasty. Furthermore you can play a co op campaign with a friend to enhance the excitement.

- Graphics: 
The graphics looks stunning especially in the huge open world map featuring ancient China, probably the best looking Strategy game in the market as of today.

- Optimization:
As I've mentioned earlier I've not played any of the other games in the Total War franchise and this one's my first, but people online are saying TWTK has the best performance out of all the Total War games. As for my opinion, it does running smoothly, especially considering this game featuring a gigantic map and combat of sometimes, thousands units killing each other.

Cons:

-Developer's Greediness
The game's DLC Yellow Turban Rebellion was set as a Pre Order DLC, for those who bought this game a week from its release to persuade people to buy it within its release time, (I know this is considered legitimate nowadays in the gaming industry but it's still doesn't make it OKAY in my book) And to make things worse, Creative Assembly had the nerves to release a DLC pack for blood. BLOOD. A fucking graphic setting!!!!, And for 3$ no less!

Some people are debating online whether its ethical and, the people who are defending CA are saying, that they release the blood DLC in order to reduce its ESRB rating, to make it more viable. Since in China there's alot of regulations about these terms. But if that's the case, why not make the DLC free? Or 00.1$? Nope, 3$. ""We made you buy a 60$ game, now we're gonna milk you further with this blood dlc which should've been released in the game HAHA""...

- Soundtrack:
To be honest, the soundtrack in TWTK is decent, but I was expecting better OSTS, I felt underwhelmed with the game's music and I was expecting better. With that being said, it's ain't bad. Just underwhelming.

- Mods:
It's been more than a month and this game still doesn't have a mods workshop to create new content with it, even though the developers have stated that it will be likely be released in July. Players are losing interest fast in the game and the game has already lost a huge amount of the playerbase in a month. There are mods available online, but not so many. especially for a game with this much modding potential.

-Bugs:
I've never experienced any game breaking bugs, but I've read online that some people did, even though this game is probably the most polished Total War game on release. I did however ran into a problem, there's this warlord called Yuan Shao, he gets an early status bonuses and he has the ability to vassalize other nations.

The problem began for me for me in 2 campaigns at around turn 50, this Yuan Shao suddenly began vassalizing nations, 2 at a turn, at turn 60 he has over 8 nations vassalized.. Now how do I go about eliminating him when if attack him or any of his vassals he would declare war on me with his 10 nations and destroy me? Thankfully the problem was patched and he got his ass nerfed, 3 times I should mention, YES HE WAS THAT BROKEN, but the last patch seemed to calm him down, at least in my last 2 campaigns.


Conclusion:
This game went from: ""Hey cool looking game, I might buy it"" to a freaking masterpiece and probably the best strategy game I have ever played. It even has gotten me interested in China history and lore and I was actually reading online about some of the characters and the settings, not many games do that to me! I never played the other Total War games, but if they're half as good as this one, I am in for a treat! 10/10 a MASTERPIECE! for me!

I'd recommend this when it goes down to 30$
Let's see, The GOOD things are:
-Best Diplomacy mechanics yet out of all the games. Factions don't attack you without reason and are open to peace +more
-The concept of having hero generals is cool and isn't poorly implemented. And there is the option to play classic mode.
-Towns have adequate garrison units. So factions can't blow through your back lines as easily.
-Food resources are key and holding these points, or taking them makes a big difference.
Honestly that's all that impressed me from past games

The Bad:
-Unit variety is very boring.
-Unit art style is very boring
-Troop combat is very boring. To me it's just flashy and way over the top
-No unit death animations like in shogun.
-Agents are boring. They can be effective, but I miss my assassins.

For instance, the master strategist Cao Cao can start proxy wars and manipulate relations between factions to his advantage (much like the real-life schemer) whilst the Tyrant Dong Zhuo lets the player intimidate other factions into accepting diplomatic deals. He can even use this to bully other factions into giving him money or land for free!

The music is simply incredible, and like Shogun 2 it blends in with a distinct art style and optional Chinese audio to immerse the player in 3rd century China. 

Characters are still bonkers and some (like Lü Bü) is worth 1000 normal soldiers if micromanaged properly! Players from the Warhammer Total Wars will right at home here. But if that isn't your cup of tea you can always switch over to ""Records mode"" where generals are accompanied by a bodyguard and function very much like the classical TW games. Fatigue is also increased to make battles feel less arcade-y and more tactical. 

Recruitment has been revamped, where different classes of characters can recruit different types of units. Which means that you are no longer bogged down by spamming barracks that inevitably become inefficient as your borders expand away from them, which really makes the game feel more fast paced and dynamic! (Though I imagine this might not sit well with everyone)

All in all, it is an incredibly atmospheric, immersive and fun experience which anyone interested in strategy games will find thoroughly enjoyable!

The Beta patch which fixed birth rates and lowered Yuan Sho's (think that is the right Yuan :) ) tendency to vassalize everybody by turn 10 makes the game much more playable, especially if you start near him.  The combat is a bit more challenging than some of the other Total War games I have played and your Generals definitely play a big role in battles. One of the things I find confusing is that everytime the leader changes or a faction progresses to the next level the name of the faction changes so it is hard to keep track of who you like and who you don't.  Also a lot of the flags are very similar so again it takes some time to figure out who is who on the map. That is about the only thing i don't like about the game, that and the fact that there are so many characters with similar names it can be hard to keep them straight.

If you are new or a long time fan, this game has a lot to offer you.

On the hand you have Cao Cao, who is all about pitting other warlords against each other with his proxy war mechanic, letting you play the 'Game of Thrones' with diplomacy.
All factions have a large roster of units they can choose from, although most only have two or three unique units to choose from.

Firstly I do think the game is good, it's plenty of fun, especially if you enjoy the time-period. Now the best things about it is basically the fact diplomacy is a lot better in this game than any of the older ones. It just makes the game so much better, and so I do believe that this is the right direction for Total War in terms of diplomacy. The generals are decently well done, and I like most of the abilities and ancillaries they have available. There's a few nit-picks I could make on it, but it's not a major issue. As for armies in general, well it's more or less the same units with some specific faction units per most factions. So in that regard it's very much like Shogun 2, and the reform tree is the same for nearly every faction too. The only factions that are massively different in how they play and in how the reform tree looks is the Yellow Turbans. Sure most factions have some unique mechanics, buildings or units, but it's not so different you can't adopt a similar strategy for most of them. The Yellow Turbans have vastly different building effects, most of the time providing base income instead of massive multipliers, and having quite a few ways to generate public order or satisfaction, instead of ways to reduce corruption. 

That stated let's look at the economy, firstly I do like that I can adjust taxes again, I like my tax slider, don't take away the tax slider. The economy is fairly simple all things considered. I like trade influence, but having a monopoly doesn't provide a big trade benefit, you don't get more influence for controlling all of a specific resource than if you just had one instance of it. Which sure if you have a monopoly on a resource, you have more trade influence than everyone else as a base (this is also saying you own at least one resource building for all the other resources). Now I think if you own most of a specific resource, or monopolize it, than you should have a lot more trade influence. If you have two sources of spice, and someone else has only one source of it, than you should have more trade influence then them because you have more spice (again this is considering that everything else is the same). As for the rest of the economy, it's even simpler, trade influence is interesting to be introduced, and I like that, but the rest of the economy is even more boring. 

We have commerce, Industry, and peasantry incomes for all factions, Kong Rong gets culture income from his unique building but not enough changes to everything else for that culture income to receive good multipliers. Now the economy being simple isn't really bad, but the way it's handled is rather boring. Also the AI tends to build some pretty stupid things, like having multipliers to commerce, without any income for commerce (and this was a regional city, with no other regions providing commerce, it was Chen if you want to know exactly, AI Cao Cao built no commerce in Chen, no excuse, it's just stupid). Easiest way to fix this, make the main settlement building provide income from commerce and a multiplier to peasantry instead (then the population provide the base income for peasantry). Sure the peasantry switch isn't overly important, but I just think that makes a bit more sense. The important thing is the commerce, cause generally I see the AI less often building things that only benefit Industry, they still do at times, but it's not as often nor as big an issue. And that's it for economy.

When it's all said and done, the game isn't the best Total War out there, but it does introduce some new mechanics (and re-introduce some old ones), and have the best diplomacy, so it's a step in the right direction for Total War games. If they update the game to better balance some things, and release good DLC than I can easily see this being a very popular Total War game for a long time to come (also I imagine if they give us the right modding tools, than that's just instantly gonna open up and lead to great things). Thanks for reading, and do keep in mind, this is my thoughts, if you think otherwise it's fine, I like the game, but do like talking about the flaws of a game in more detail than the stuff they did well, cause it's very easy to see when something is done well (or at least it should be).",1561920215,1561920215,True,0.0,True,False,False,802,en

So I have quite the history in terms of being biased toward this title (therefore, you can take a jug of salt and chug it down your throat if you want for this review) and I am a fan of this era (I am a Chinese after all...). This game has been quite the adventure for me as I have anxiously waited for so long for the release of the game with the mixed previews from game critics and total war communities in mind (i.e. people thought that this title would flop harder than Thrones of Britannia). Either way, I was skeptical for this release. However, I still believe in CA to release a decent product due to Warhammer I and II being quite well received. With all the emotions in mind, I approached this game with optimism when it was released and I wasn't completely disappointed. NOW BACK ON TO THE SHOW AND THANK YOU for listening to my soap opera.

Review: So Total War: 3K has been a excellent addition to the Total War franchise as it covers almost all different cultures and ethnicities in historical time period (*looking at Africa*). The game is probably one of the best optimized so far recently compared to the likes of Warhammer (Still could not finish my ME Kroq Gar campaign *sad) and it runs smooth like butter, so props for that. I love the artistic style they went for this game as it is fitting for the time period and culture (e.g. LITERAL technology tree, map layout, and UI). Now it is quite hard to summarize everything in a paragraph (and it is hard to read), so LET'S MAKE A PROS AND CONS LIST (everyone loves it):

PROS:
- Very well optimized (had one crash so far)
- Immersive art styles and graphics (though there's some things I want to touch on in terms of cons)
- Cool Dueling mechanics
- RPG mechanics (e.g. equiping characters with items, which allows for better attachment towards your characters)
- Selection between Historical and Romance Mode
- Diplomacy: OK I have to give this a thorough review, this is the first time that CA actually give in their effort to try to make diplomacy interesting and THEY DID. It is very interesting to see different mechanics being introduced (e.g. coalition, numerical values of signing agreements, unique faction actions like Cao Cao's proxy wars, etc.) and being well implemented since it is their first time attempting to improve diplomacy.
- Family tree and relationship development (though this is also a con in some ways)

Cons:
- Seems like a unfinished product as a lot of legendary/generic characters do not have unique protraits (e.g. Xun Yu, Xun You, Guo Jia, Huang Gai, Zhang He, etc.) and a lot of the characters in-game seems to be made up or doesn't exist in that era. In addition, I would believe CA would eventually release campaigns for different time frame during the Three Kingdoms Era as dlcs (e.g. Battle of Chibi, Battle of Guandu, Battle of Wuzhang Plains, etc.). I would wished they have release more of that during their postpone release of 3K.
- Battles: Alright... I have a mixed view of this topic as battles can be fun sometimes, but as you progress further into the campaign it became more dull as it is the same hammer and anvil strategy over and over again (though so variations exist AKA CHEESE). Either way, it is very enjoyable to see Zhang Fei and Lu Bu can take on a whole army by themselves, but that devalues the units you have in your army and they become quite useless sometimes (they are just eye candy MMM...). Siege battles are still the same as other total war games (NERF TOWERS PLS) and I would like to see improvements on that...
- UI: It is a lot of information thrown at you at once, so you get overwhelmed with the information presented, but if you spend sometime with it you'll get use to it. HOWEVER, there are some information that is very hard to find like how corruption is calculated (it doesn't really show that to you), and character relationship is a mess like spider webs. Idk how they going to fix this, but maybe mods or they will figure something out...

OVERALL: I really like this game and I want it to be successful (being Chinese and all that). Yes, this game has flaws, it is not a perfect game, but is it worth buying and playing? (That's up to you to decide, but I would suggest buying it on sale until they add more content and improve some areas, unless you are a fan of the era/dynasty warriors fans). So there you go, I apologize for the lengthy review, but this is the one that I care the most about... Either way THANK YOU AND SEE YOU ALL ON THE BATTLEFIELD!!!

Three Kingdoms, the age of heroes, when many great generals , strategists and political figures get on the stage of history to reshape the fate of China in countless battles. In East Asian, they treat this novel as a the Bible for Diplomatic and Tactical thinking. All countries in East Asian culture group : Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese love it. 

Japanese has successfully introduce this period to the West via Dynasty Warriors, Romance of Three Kingdoms and Kessen.

For any of you who's not familiar with the settings, the story happens during 3rd century in China. 

Han Empire , after almost 500 years of successful ruling human world  ( ancient China called their land as Tian Xia , or Great Country under the Heaven , and their Emperor is the one sent by God to rule the human world ), starts showing signs of weakness. Struggles for power in the Emperor Court lead to the establishment of 18 Warlords Coalition , leading by YuanShao against DongZhuo. Shortly after that, each warlords has their own ambitions and everyone want to seize power from the Emperor, get rid of the old and crumble Han Empire and start their own dynasties. From here, the story begins.

I was very excited when CA announced that they will make a Total War game cover this period. Many great improvements from other Total war tittles that have been successful rolling out in this game , yet there 're still some to improve

+Pros

Beautiful landscape  of ancient China is showed in World Map

Battles was added with Duel Mode, this never happen in other Total War before, great improvement from War hammer 2 when generals having their own space to fight with each other

Interesting Diplomacy system, if you want to survive in middle or end game, you should master it

Each Warlords have the own global strength to conquer the map

Creative recall / mustering feature that helps armies marching across the map within 3- 5 turns, it might take 20+ turn easily if this system not exist in late game


Good optimization, my game run smoothly in battles and turn end very fast 


+Con:

World map and Battle Map look like two different art styles, nothing related at all, I feel like they were created by two different team. World map show the beautiful and authenticity of ancient China in artistic way. Battle Map just like a copy paste from some old Total war game :

-Lack of mountain height. Remember in Rome 2, Shogun 2 or Medieval 2 where your unit were camping on top of super high mountains waiting for enemies to come for an ambush ? This 's not exist in Three Kingdoms, even the most mountainous region is Shu ( West of China, close to Himalaya ), Battle Map only show small little hills like a sand dune

-Grass look like coral , very cheap and lazy design , in the trailer it looks tall and thin :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UhSsPhIpqM

-Lack of tree showing Asian plants : only bamboo and cherry blossoms I 've seen so far . If removed those and the mountain afar, everything else looks like copy paste  directly from EU map . Asian pine tree was in Shogun 2 if I was correct but in here nowhere to be seen even in World Map there are a lots.

-The city walls looks comically short compare to any castles or cities in Rome 2 or Shogun 2

There was no naval battles


Poor sync animation for units fighting, I understand that Warhammer series each race have the downsizes so it's not comparable like Shogun 2 to add complex fighting animation ( in Warhammer 2 they added quite a few good one for units vs units ) . For Three Kingdoms its human vs. human too, and the fight was seriously lack of depth, most of the time you see units swinging in the air and the dude on other side just fall off the ground for no reason

The fighting animation look super cartoonish . Like something straight from Kungfu Panda, nothing like Rome 2 or Shogun 2. This due to the fact that they try to reduce the level of violent so they can sell the game in Chinese market, where it has more strict regulation rules, and it has proven successful when 300 millions copies were sold in May . I would like to see they adding more animations for mature audiences, even if it was DLC

Character design looks awful:

-GuanYu and ZhangFei are somewhat consist with other games and historic portraits. 

-Somehow they made Liubei 's nose extremely large for Asian face like an exaggerate version of Jackie Chan . 

-YuanShao a powerful warlord who leading a Coalition of 18 lords fighting agaisnt DongZuo and Lubu, instead of making him looks powerful and respectable, CA given him a looks that just like Po ( again, from Kunfu Panda ) yelling and whinning 24/7

-ZhugeLiang, the God of Wisdom in novel looks like an Asian drug dealer 

-Another one GanNing , yes he was a bandit in the novel, in game looks like a street robber

-CA only invest their time and effort in 20 famous generals. The rest looks super generics and borings. Will there be DLC to declone the rest of them ?


The UI looks confusing as fuck, took me almost 3 days to understand what's going on in my campaign

Unit design isn't that great, most units seems lack of strength and energy to fight:

- High tier unit with armors seems like they wearing something straight from Fallout serries

-There is no one pushing the Ram any more ? unlike other Total War games, this is a new level of laziness

Lack of recruitable generals in talent pool:

-I realize the most challenging thing is not economy or battles but the number of retinue you can hire at end game phase. I can have up to 16 stacks but due to continuous battles, only 7-12 stacks are available and the talent pool empty most of the time

Meanwhile my final opponents always at full stack even though he like 1/3 of my size, i used a spy and realize that he has like 15 - 30 generals are in line to be recruit so AI never run out of generals no matter how often you execute their generals at the end of battles

-Suggestion for developers:

Need  new DLC to declone generals and invest more in artstyle

Need new DLC to add more animations for all units in the fight, right now zoom in to see the fight looks super boring and General duels animations become repetitive after a while. Best advise is create new Game Engine to replace WarScape, it has been almost 20 years since Rome . Back then it was a major hit in gaming industry, now it become clunky when watching unit fights, may be CA could create something like Mount and Blade with better hitbox and smoother animations for the battles.

Need to invest more on unit design, like now units all have weird portion and very cartoonish looks compare to other Total War games

-Please have a looks at the following

Tiger Knights, my favorite game, unit looks pretty slick, clean design, more mature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RutUOHn1MxQ

Rise of Three Kingdoms mod, from Medieval 2 , less cartoonish than this game :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3DCNXL43HQ


Group up news on World Map under different section like Economy, Diplomacy, Battles, etc. with small notification like a mail box so we can sort out each new we want to read. Currently in end game phase i have 20-30 news each turns stack on top of each other like block chain and it super hard to do mini click between each of them ( there is no Previous / Next message options ) 

Giving players option to reduce number of flags each armies unit carries

Allow us to select Subtitles for the game, I would like to understand what my armies saying in Chinese, just like watching a good Japanese samurai movie in Japanese, we need  Subtitles

Is it your dream to become Emperor?

If you anwsered yes on all of these, you should buy it for sure.

Now, over to the more serious review.

Total War games have always been a fun experience for me. Starting with nothing, and building my empire by out thinking my enemies. Not too hard in this game, but I am not one to talk since I never play Legendary campaigns.

This particular game has the same recipe as most other TW games, however with a few key improvements.

1. Better Diplomacy

Yes, it is indeed better. However, there still needs to be changes because like anything in the world, it is not perfect.
Other factions declaring war on your vassal while you are at good terms with them, AI vassalising themselves to someone they have barely met or not be in danger what so ever to feel the need to become a vassal. Just a few things that bothered me.

2. More detailed Generals

Yes, these generals have become more in debt then ever before. However, the generic poses and same type of clothing make it a bit stale. There is still not really a personal bond with them, and I could care less if someone died besides my own Legendary Lord. (Why did you have to die of old age YUAN SHAO!)

3. Color coded armies and buildings.

Plain and simple, makes it easier to understand what you need to do. However, I would like to see more information on the impact of Corruption and Income differences. They seem not be equal (by reading other reviews).

I personally really enjoy the Chinese voice acting! Every time you issue an order to your units, the general will cry ""<Unit Name> 領命 (Lingming)"", which roughly means ""<Unit Name>"" receive this order!"", and the units respond with either ""諾 (Nuo - meaning Affirmative)"", or ""遵命 (Zunming [The Z is pronounced like a soft J] - meaning ""As you command"").
This really adds to the authenticity, and I am really happy that CA put in all these extra details! It shows that they are really respectful of the subject matter! I hate it when games either exoticise the east, or use campy stereotypes.

One of the best Total War experiences you can have. A few caveats tough:

[list]
    [*] The transition can be a bit harsh if you're used to regular total war games. I heard Thrones of Britania is quite similar but I've never played it myself. Do not discard diplomacy in this game. I've found making or joining coalitions is pretty much essential. And your heroes are pretty much the most important units you have if playing in Romance mode.
    [*] The graphics seemed really faded and muted at first. It took some fiddling to get them to look aesthetically appealing. For some reason Records mode graphics mostly turn everything a tint of dark green for some reason while Romance seems more like real life.

If you're just starting out, the yellow turban DLC should be a slightly more conventional experience to ease you into the rest of the game as there isn't as much of a focus on diplomacy and gives you a bit more freedom to do what you want.",1561885650,1561885650,True,0.0,False,False,False,174,en

The Chinese voice overs (enable it in menu) are really good but the battle taunts get repetitive after 1 hour and you'll likely want to disable that function.

For the faction choices, there are quite a few factions to choose from. I think you would like it more if you know stuff about the Three Kingdoms period because you can then play as your favourite characters. For their unique units, buildings and abilities, there are sufficient differences for some characters. The Yellow Turbans have a different technology system and unit roster as compared to the rest.

For the campaign map, it is quite big and with varied sceneries to represent the different landscape China has to offer. Though the building system may be somewhat limited due to a rather limited roster and a few ""must have"" buildings, it still works. There's food, trade, population, public order, revolts etc.

The main plus point in the campaign would be diplomacy. It has improved a lot as compared to previous titles, as there are more options to choose from and diplomatic alliances or agreements matter more in this game. The spy system though sometimes useful, can be neglected. Still, there should be changes to better include UI and tooltips regarding administrators, the family tree and recruitment.

For battles, the maps are an upgrade as compared to previous games based on looks. Towers and trebuchets are potent in this game. The tactics used are about the same as other Total War games but in Romance mode, the duels look good and the generals are essentially tanks. A limited unit roster does make gameplay slighty more repetitive sometimes but it's Total War.

Sieges can be quite similar though. Most often it is trebuchet for towers/walls -> archers for towers/units) -> duel to decrease morale (if you win) -> charge and repeat
Granted there are variations of walled town sieges and resource sieges, they roughly play out about the same. Sometimes if you outnumber the AI in artilery they would charge out in resource battles which makes it easier since they bottleneck at the entrances and with flaming shot for trebuchets it's over.
It's quite fun for the first 100+ times maybe, after that no so. Perhaps more options to use while defending or attacking would help (hot oil down the walls, booby traps, tunneling under walls)

There's a lack of Naval Combat which is a bit sad but then again, it is difficult to put it into this game. Perhaps there can be DLCs which has scenarios that allow naval combat to be implemented (Korea stuff) or there can even be focused maps that make the rivers larger and more important than it is now.

As for character portraits, let's just use mods because other than the few unique characters they're all about the same and it is hard to have as much fun as when you have had the unique characters. Probably an expansion would be put out sometime later.

Overall, if you like China and Chinese history this is a very good game. I bought it at launch and felt that I have enjoyed it enough to warrant the purchase, I think it's one of the more polished and smooth Total War games. But I'm still kind of salty about have to pay for blood in this game though... The title is literally ""Total War""",1561868071,1561868071,True,0.0,True,False,False,579,en

This is a rare improvement in the series in my eyes.  The series has a horrible history of really bad feature creep.  The feature balance in TWTK feels incredibly well done.  It felt familiar to me in ways that Attila and Rome 2 didn't.

I was extremely sceptical about 3 kingdoms. I still remeber the sore deception of Rome 2 and was wondering how it was possible to go from a polished and well refined game such as Shogun 2 to the sorry sh*t that is Rome 2.

Seeing many gameplay of 3 kingdoms, I had Rome 2 ptsd flashbacks all over again. The graphics looked cartoonish, the Combat IA looked horrible. I though it was a way for creative Assembly to test the terrain for the mobile game industry.

Well, Ive seen released content gameplay of the game ans decided to give it a chance.. Turns out, it was a good decision. Three kingdoms is the best Total war game Ive played since Shogun 2. While the combat IA can be exploited in siege battles and can make the mistakes of puting some of its unit in questionnable situation, it is not as drastic as I feared for. And is even somewhat better than Shogun 2 (land battle,not sieges wise).

But... it comes at no one surprise to know that the game shines at the campaign part. Even the greatest Total war veteran will have to spend dozens of hours to learn every single features. I am extremely satisfied with how the game turned out to be. With its Romance and Record mode, the game should satisfy both the historical and the Dynasty warrirors' fans.

I've seen a bunch of review criticizing the game about its campaign complexity.. I will never understand this kind complains. Isnt it good when a game turns out to be both complexe and rewarding instead of being casual? The player has the choice to set the difficulty of the campaign to easy or medium if they just want a straightforward campaign. But please, let the gamers enjoy a game that finally takes minimal time of investment to master the game instead of just being spoonfed by simplistics features. A lot of works has been made by the devs and you can just feel it by experiencing the best campaign game since Rome 1 or Shogun 2.",1561858028,1561858028,True,0.0,False,False,False,378,en

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*]Romance Mode. Your generals are larger than life characters who can take on entire units of enemy soldiers or use buffs and debuffs. If you have Total War: Warhammer 1/2 you know what I'm talking about. [i] There is also a records mode for those of you who enjoy the classic total war experience [/i]
[*]Better and more complex diplomacy options, the larger factions feel more unique in diplomacy.
[*]Beautiful campaign map and art style which is pleasing to look at. Soundtrack is also great!
[*]New overhauled spy system which can help you completely take over another faction from the inside.
[*]Character interaction (banter) on the battle field which can be amusing at times. However it can get repetitive at times! They also develop as friends or enemies depending on interactions on and off the battle field!
[*]Family tree and office positions.
[*]New recruitment system, you now recruit units instantly but they then spend 2-5 turns mustering before they are fully ready for combat!
[*]Every playable faction have some unique buildings, units and a certain [i] power [/i] (Some thing that affects your faction as a whole and make different factions have very different campaigns.)
[*]Flaming arrows that have impact on how the battlefield looks and how units perform. And fire spreads fast enough for it to be effective [i] It's pretty op [/i]
[*]5 Types of characters: Strategist, Vanguard, Commander, Sentinel and Champion.
[*]Ancillaries: You can get a lot of unique items, weapons and armor to give away to your generals and administrators to make them even better. [i] I believe these are only available in romance mode, though i could be wrong. [/i]
[*]Reform system [i] Technology tree [/i] 
[/list]

[b] Pros/Cons [/b]
[list]
[*]Dueling (In romance mode). Generals can go head to head in a duel to the death or until either party retreats. [i] Can be seen as both a pro and a con since a lot of the time the enemy won't even accept the duels you are offering. [/i]
[*]Most major siege battles are pretty similar, the smaller settlements that have resources are more unique. [i] The large sieges are big enough that you can attack from all sides like in previous historical titles and not like in Total War: Warhammer 1/2 where you can only attack from one side [/i]
[*]Only one option for artillery.
[*]Formations, the formations that are in the game are good and powerful but you can't really access them without a strategist unless you have certain ancillaries. 
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*]No naval battles
[*]Battle Ai is still pretty dumb.
[*]Most units look the same except the absolute top tier units who look different from the lower tier but look like eachother. [i] This is a major con of you are coming from the Total War: Warhammer series. [/i]
[*]Dull late game, mostly because there is no simple way to manage all your buildings and commanderies and it just takes to long to do all them.

All in all i think it's great and if you like other total war games i think you should pick it up!

First, the good of the game.

It looks quite pretty, even on medium settings, which is always a nice perk of a game. After all, who likes looking at a screen filled with migraine inducing imagery? +4

The unit detail is quite nice, and it's always such fun clubbing the Yellow Turbans as a Coalition/Governor faction.

Speaking of factions, I like that you are able to recognize quite a few of the characters names if you know anything about Three Kingdoms history, such as from the actual book or from games such as Dynasty Warriors. Liu Bei, the Warlord Cao Cao, The ""Little Conqueror"" Sun Ce, etc. +3

The campaign Map is Massive, though this isn't always a ""Good"" thing, since some people will give up on campaigns before they actually take all of the commanderies/settlements they need. +1/2

Lu Bu is Strong, but he doesn't have a bow like it was said he wielded. + 1/2

Units can eliminate generals even on Romance mode, which is always a great thing, and a necessity for any Total war. Beware Lu Bu though. Just use archers on him. +2


Now, the Bad.

The variety of units is kind of low, which is understandable, but dissapointing all the same. If they added tribal like units that would be a neat addition to me and would cause me to revise this part of the review. -1

Certain heroes can annihilate entire armies (Looking at you Lu Bu and He Man.) which is entirely frustrating unless you're the one doing it. Or, they have abilities that can route the entire army. (Zhang Fei.) Some change is probably needed, so that there's less army obliteration. -2

Plus, I've always been saying that if they really want TOTAL war, they should go to China with it. The Three Kingdoms period caused the total population of China -- as in census values, not just army losses -- to drop by about three quarters. (From a little over 56 million to slightly over 16 million.) Armies routinely exceeded over 10% of the total population (TOTAL, not just adult males) and starvation and disease followed the ensuing economic collapse and looting.

This is a good game overall and many technical issues I had with previous titles were not present here. This game is surprisingly well optimized, at least for me, so kudos is in order for creative assembly.

One of the biggest strengths this game has is the overworld campaign. It is simply the best of all the Total War games. Is it the deepest or the best in the genre? No, but it's certainly a massive improvement and it actually feels like a proper campaign of sorts. The presentation is aesthetically pleasing as well. The battles, especially in Romance Mode are fun to watch play out the maps can be gorgeous at times and great overall.

It's a great game, but not without its flaws. Armies still haven't gotten any bigger from previous titles. Even if you go with the more realistic, historical mode the unit size stays the same with the general only having a few bodyguards instead of being super powerful. You need a pretty powerful PC to have pretty large battles. Anything nearing 10k soldiers in total may strain lower end PCs. The AI is also meh and it's possible to figure out its strategy (or at times lack of strategy) but I'll admit I'm no expert and can still find it competent on certain occasions. Another issue I have is that even though the battles can be entertaining some of the animations are off for individual units. The characters are fine for the most part with the occasional awkward parry or lunge, but the other units seem to clip into each other a lot or just stand around. Rome 2 had very good battle animations for all units imo, this one is meh in this regard. It isn't as noticeable if you stay zoomed out, but if you're like me and like to zoom in real close into the battles to witness the carnage or set up pretty silly scenarios then can probably put you off. For me, it isn't much of an issue but the reign of blood dlc was a must for me and I would recommend it.

Although, I wrote more about what I didn't like than what I did, I hope you don't get the impression that I didn't enjoy it. My complaints are mostly nitpicks, and I'm a pretty casual player to the series. I greatly enjoyed playing the game but I would still recommend reading other reviews if you're still on the fence so that you get a much clearer picture if it's a game you want to invest your time in, because it can get pretty addicting. Personally, I definitely recommend this game to fans of the series who want something a more character-centered Total War campaign and to newcomers of the series.",1561841624,1561841624,True,0.0,True,False,False,475,en

- Multiple functions in the game have a great synergy with each other, province reasorces -> city buildings to build -> characters -> tech tree.

You're dropped right into the chaos of ancient China, where you'll take charge of some of the most legendary chinese generals of that era.

Pros:
+ Graphics are amazing and the game seems optimized (I'm using GTX1060 4gb ASUS TURBO)
+ The duel animations are well done
+ Best diplomacy in a Total War game
+ Good character progression, little bit of RPG elements
+ Immersive world, interesting historical era
+ Generals exchanging dialogue
+ Battle AI seems OK
+ Historical battles are OK, although I haven't yet finished Red Cliffs battle
+ Two campaign modes add more replayability and player choice.

Cons:
- Poor unit variety, no naval battles
- Siege battles aren't that exciting but better than Warhammer's, towers are OP unless you have flaming arrows, Battering ram and trebuchet are your only siege equipment
- Campaign map borders and factions can be confusing
- The UI can be problematic at the beginning
- Some units need to be balanced, why the fuck does elite shock cavalry need so much time to rout archer militia?
- No good tutorials for beginners
- Campaign AI declares war on you for no fucking reason. (They take one farming settlement and sue for peace via trade items)
- There are some exploits you can take advantage of.

To sum it up: A beautiful game and an interesting era for a total war series. It can be overwhelming for new players and the developers need to fix some stuff.

Score: 6.8/10

I was interested in the new setting, so I picked it up. It's been a good value for me so far, being basically how I would expect a Total War game to be, with some new features that are fun. 

I enjoy being able to use named characters in roles of your choice, rather than the old general / agent scheme. Diplomacy seems to have improved considerably, with the decisions nations make seeming more sensible. I also like the option of playing either the more traditional Total War battle style, or the kind of silly but fun and cartoonish romance mode, where generals can be heroic army defeating gods.

Although there seem to be a decent number of different units available, in practice, all factions have pretty much the same units. They are at least all generally useful in their role, and some can be very effective with a general having certain unlocked skills for them. I've only played the campaign as a couple of the factions, and while they had most of the same units to chose from, the campaign plays differently due to different faction abilities and restrictions.

Now on the good things:
3K is very well optimized and runs super smooth. I recommend installing on SSD so battle load times are quick otherwise for some reason maps load a bit slow.
Graphics are cute-ish cartoon-ish which personally doesnt botter me but i understand why some people are a bit tilted by this.
The best thing about this  game is the improved grand campaign:
+AI is better.
+ Diplomacy is interesting and meaningful.
+ Trading is really important to keep your economy healthy.
+ Betrayals and unpredictability.
+ Vassal system is a bit weird but overall alliences and vassalage is useful now.

Overall i feel the UI and gameplay improvements they added in this game are great and they need to make it into the Warhammer 3 and all future games CA makes.

- Romance mode with super hero generals is kinda lame (personal opinion).
- Lack of unit variety, and the weird way recruitment is restricted kinda ruins compositions for me. Its both a good and bad system and im not sure which way i lean more toward.
- Need better and more detailed unit and general portraits. Its just super plain and boring.

Verdict: If you want more realilistic setting and have a weaker PC get this and you`ll have tons of fun. The technical improvements to the grand campaign make this a really great experience.
But the huge map and variety of WH2 still keeps it supreme in my eyes.

I can tell you that, as someone who read Romance of the Three Kingdoms, this game impressed the hell out of me. The attention to detail is astounding. For the most part, the warlords act the way they were portrayed in the novel - Cao Cao the devious manipulator, Lu Bu the ludicrously strong warrior, Liu Bei the virtuous scion of the Han, etc. Characters in general comprise a large part of the gameplay. Their personalities affect their relationships with the people they work and fight alongside, which impart bonuses or debuffs. I found myself paying attention to even my generic characters, assembling teams that would jive well and lay waste to enemies.

Combat looks amazing. You've got large armies with different units clashing and generals dueling it out one-on-one, all on beautiful maps with terrain advantages and disadvantages. You can ambush enemies from the forest. You can lay siege to a city and rain flaming artillery onto the defending peasants. I encourage everyone to zoom in with the camera and see the carnage up-close if you're winning a battle and it makes no difference whether you're commanding well or not. Just take the visuals in. They're spectacular.

Let's get into some negatives. Campaign movement in this game is BS. I've had the game decide that my generals need to take 5 turns to move a few inches forward on the campaign map while the enemy runs around with impunity. Chasing the enemy around the campaign map gets really old really fast. Diplomacy also needs some tweaking. I was once best friends with another faction and at war with a third faction. The first faction decided to vassalize the second faction and all of a sudden they hate me because I had a war with one of their vassals. Speaking of vassalization, the AI vassalizes much easier compared to the player. A game about a bunch of factions all vying against one another feels more like a game where a bunch of factions are all united against you.

Also, remember how character personalities and relationships are important? Cue 2 of my characters, who are best friends, suddenly gain some random traits that make them despise each other. Zheng Jiang and Lu Zheng, sworn sisters, started hating each other at around turn 3 in my campaign. Oh and Zheng Jiang randomly got injured hunting while invading an enemy city so she couldn't fight in the siege. 

Finally, spies are FUCKING USELESS. I don't know how people have gotten any use out of them. Mine get recruited and defect 10 turns later (but their satisfaction just happens to drop like a rock right AFTER they defect). Every. Time.

So sometimes the game can be infuriating, but the positives unequivocally outweigh the negatives. I recommend Total War Three Kingdoms with zero qualms.",1561822431,1561822431,True,0.0,False,False,False,491,en

Balance is fine. Factions could be a bit more diverse. Not Warhammer-diverse, but a bit more than different colours and slightly better stats would've been nice. AI behavior is good enough for most players to not notice how easily it can be exploited.

Not for the faint-hearted when it comes to DLC's. Prices are high and some DLC's are, bluntly said, a fucking joke nobody thinks to be funny. Time will tell if the DLC's can be subtantial enough to warrent those high prices the Total-War community (for what ever reason) has learned to accept.

While the game offers you a few turns to get accustomed to things, it doesn’t hold your hand in anyway, which I think is preferable, as it makes you feel like you’re in charge of your faction’s fate.   There are so many systems in place, but it does not require vast knowledge of them to conquer China.  You can ruthlessly cut down all opposition, maneuver politically to place yourself in a position of power, use spies to destroy factions from within, or anything in between.
If I had to fault it for anything, as a 3 kingdoms buff, the actual historical references are somewhat limited.  Major historical figures like Guan Yu and Sima Yi are given unique art assets, but these comprise a minority of the hundreds of available officers who have randomly generated art assets instead.  They do offer some scenarios to play through some of the historical battles of the time period, though I haven’t been able to explore this fully yet.
In conclusion, if you’re at all interested in the time period or strategy games or both, this is a must purchase.

- Dunno if its bug, intentional, or fan service, but there are wayyy too many female warlords and female warriors. 
I don't mean to be bad, but its kinda unrealistic. I understand that wife of the warlord might took charge of nation, but AFAIK, it should only last until his son comes of age and they only led behind the scene. Its really weird to see Wu led by Sun Jian's wife instead while Sun Ce only leading a small contingent of troops, or Ma Chao that should have been the heir after Ma Teng's death, but instead, his mother is the one who became the lord. One of my playthroughs consist of 7 female warlords and only 2 male (including me). PS: most of them, have their former sons already at available age to be heir before their father died). Thats not even including another womens who lead their army on the field.

-The next Total war game is a direct and immediate sequel to Warhammer.

Thankfully, it did.

Three Kingdoms review:
Three Kingdoms isn't as good as Shogun 2 and Rome 1 and perhaps not even as good as Medieval 2 in my opinion.  I played more than 3000 hours of medieval 2.  I probably won't play close to half that of three kingdoms.

pros:
+great diplomacy the likes of which has never been seen before in A Total War game.
+late game is one of the most challenging to date.
+good campaign
+you get to choose between the romanticised romance mode and the more historically caring records mode.
+certainly not the worst Ai although still not as good as Shogun 2, at least and especially when it come to battles.
+spying is better than it ever was.
+cool tech tree
+one of the best steam releases to date.
+++historical
+Yuan Shao's broken vassalisation has been fixed.

cons:
-battles are lacklustre and you have no choice but to fight many of them.  So Total War players who prefer auto-resolving will stuggle a bit.
-we still don't have avatar mode.
-too much micro-management
-no naval battles.
-many total war games have better portraits and better art.

variable:
-New setting(China)

Recently i have found myself feeling Total war fatigue. pretty much going through the motions and buying the latest game simply out of my love for the franchise. Then Three Kingdoms came out......what a game! I was very dubious when they announced it but i am gladly wrong. 

So on to the game- the game has two modes Records and romance. Records is your standard total war affair while romance is based on the novels that are set round this time. I will say it is the romance mode that really makes this game brilliant. the changes to how generals are handle is great and thanks to the court and  harmony system it really makes them feel apart of the game. 

In both modes you are tasked with becoming the emperor of china. you start off a warlord but as your power gains soo does your options in diplomacy and opening up opportunity for appoint generals to positions.this is another small thing that really immerses you in the game.

The graphics are high end but changeable so don't let that put you off. The music is brilliant as always for total war.

So overall i highly recommend for new players or vets.",1561802592,1561802592,True,0.0,False,False,False,217,en

Good:
Finally, they made the AI more believable on the diplomacy side. The enemy AI persona may be rapacious or conniving but not stupid.
The tech tree is wonderful to look at, not bland at all. Good job, CA.
The game runs a bit better on a halfway decent machine, compared to their earlier iterations.
Bad:  
The DLC's are overpriced. I'm still mad about that. Small DLC like ""blood"" should be at least be given free.
Where is Korea? I understand that this is about the Han Dynasty collapse but Korea is not ""undiscovered"" in this period.
More good units should be made available earlier, not unlocked after slogging through 60 or so turns in the game. Elite units should be available as mercenary units.",1561801903,1561801903,True,0.0,True,False,False,133,en

- Heroe (as TW warhammer) or Classic (as historical TW). TW TK offers a great choice in playstyle of your lords.
- Finally a TW-game with a interesting and usable diplomacy system!
- Strength and weaknesses of the different lord types as well as the bonding between the lords keeps it challenging.
- Specialize your armies: Depending on your lord / max 3 lords you get to choose from certain units.

Cons
- I like the paper/scissor/stone-principle with the units, but in my opinion the units lacks in variety.
- The battle UI.. Personaly i find it to be the biggest issue in the game.

To be honest there is a LOT to manage in TK from diplomacy, economy, and strategic matters to family and bonding of your lords. But as soon you get the hang of it, it is quite enjoyable to play your faction on so many levels and you get the feeling of being in control in to the smallest detail. Furthermore the diplomacy system offers you (especially with Cao Cao) the oportunity to intrigue your way through the game - a feature i have waited on a long time. To sum things up i find TK to be one of the best TW games and i can't wait to see, what the developers will deliver to us in the future.

It revamps everything from the combat, to the politics, micro-managing, and last but not least the root core of the game. Would I say its the best entry ever? No. But without a doubt I would say it is in the top 3 for sure next to Shogun 2 and Medieval 2. If you love the Total War series but the last few games have been lack luster for you, now is the time to join with this latest installment in the franchise! Now for cons and pros:

Pros:
-Politics in this game feel way more real and authentic, characters and actions play a much more vital role and can change how others see you drastically compared to previous titles. 
-Combat feels perfect in this game, not to slow but not fast at all to. All my matches even with over 8,000 men in battle last around 15-20 mins.
-Managing everything feels way easier and simplified. No crazy learning curve or tutorials needed as its all crunched up more to make it user-friendly.
-Romance mode is an amazing addition to the franchise and make games play out way more different than the basic Records mode that we are all familiar with. Adds depth and much more of a story than what I was expecting.
-Maps feel real and alive with rives and tree fires playing at times vital and tactical roles within the battlefields, although for me Warhammer 2 has the best campaign map Three Kingdoms does a damn good job at theirs. 
-Graphics are amazing in this game and is a jump compared to other titles, looks crisp and makes the battles and maps feel alive and breathing.

Cons:
-Units feel less diverse, more simplified which to some is great but I like to play around with my unit divisions within the overall army I have, sadly it seems only about 4 divisions are worth getting and making all the others a waste of money and hinder to the battles.
-Economy is way easier, to easy personally. Public order is to easy to maintain, I always have to much food, and rebellions are like crumbs to my garrisons. Like no challenge anymore to managing your lands. To some this is great but to a Total War vet I like a good challenge that keeps me on my feet.
-Blood is Paid DLC, still retarded.

+ This game got me into Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  I'm watching the 2010 show and loving it.  I'm listening to a podcast that goes over the whole story.  
+ Having played quite a few TW games over the years, this one finally feels like a bit more of a step in the right direction.  A little more polished, a little less buggy, a bit more original.  The Romance mode feels great as TW has never really been a full on simulator; adding a smidge of fantasy is welcome especially since the tone of the setting is part historic and part legend.
+ Diplomacy, specifically, finally feels like it got some attention.  I like that elasticity of goods is clearly shown and lets you know that trying to sell food to a food-rich nation is not going to get you much in return.

Cons:
- I almost exclusively play Multiplayer with my partner, and the lack of simultaneous turns is pretty rough.
- Having multiple armies join in a single battle is still non-intuitive; highlighting and looking for the reinforcing-arrows on the ground doesn't always seem to show the truth of things.
- 'Not a fan of the DLC culture.  I know it works or they wouldn't do it, but that doesn't mean I can't be sad that folks are voting with their $'s and perpetuating it.",1561787020,1561787020,True,0.0,True,False,False,229,en

(Before reading any reviews, you must remember that this game will not have the same fantasy elements that will be found in the Warhammer games. There are no dragons, vampires or magicians. This is a historical total war set in a period of civil war for China, all characters are Chinese and there are few variations between a warlords units.)

Three Kingdoms has a unique focus never seen before in a Total War game, characters. You don't start the game picking a faction to play, you pick a warlord. 

My first campaign was with Cao Cao, the capable minister during peacetime and a crafty hero in chaotic times. Cao Cao's exclusive ability is Credibility, you can spend these Credibility points to instigate proxy wars between two rivalling warlords, you can also use the points to increase or deteriorate relations between warlords. Effectively, you can play the campaign with limited warfare and an abundance of plotting. Cao Cao comes with two legendary heroes to  aid with his conquest of China, Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan. Both Dun and Yuan are Cao Cao's cousins and will follow him anywhere, but if their satisfaction with the faction hits 0, they will desert to another warlords court.

Heroes, as mentioned before are the life of your armies and each hero has a class. I will go into what classes are good at and bad at in battle (Heroes have buffs for settlement administration too but I won't go into that here.)

Commanders - These heroes will have melee cavalry as their preferred retinue and provide buffs to the army they're in. They can duel but it is not advisable. (Yellow)

Sentinels - These heroes will have melee infantry as their preferred retinue and are the tanks in your army, being able to hold choke points easily. They can duel and don't deal a bunch of damage but they have insane defensive abilities and are likely able to outmatch other classes. (Purple)

Champions - These heroes will have spear and glaive infantry as their preferred retinue and excel at killing enemy generals in duels, but are weak when faced with a large group of people and are easily overwhelmed. (Green)

Vanguards - These heroes will have shock cavalry as their preferred retinue and are weak against other heroes but excel against groups. (Red)

Strategists - These heroes will have ranged units as their preferred retinue and are weak against both characters and regular units. Strategists cannot duel and are extremely fragile in battle but they're necessary to success in battle as their give increased ammunition for ranged units and give armies special formations. Strategists also have the ability to fight night battles and use fire arrows for their retinue, making them extremely destructive. (Blue)

This is just the start of new features implemented into Total War: Three Kingdoms, and I implore you to buy this game. You may not like the setting but I can guarantee you will like it after you've bought this game and witnessed the rich lore behind it.

The game is great, has a unique way of looking at a Total War game and has a bunch of new features. I recommend you buy it.",1561785902,1562159683,True,0.523809552192688,True,False,False,559,en

The good: 
-Excellent duel animations (though more variety is always welcome)
-Best diplomacy system of the series.
-Character driven romance mode( I see this as a positive, others might not). A more traditional mode, a records mode is also available. 
-The addition of RPG elements in game adds immersion to the game.
-Highly polished game.

The bad:
-No significant improvement on the battle side.
-Lack of unit variety (can be expanded  upon through dlcs)
-Some game mechanics are not well explained and require further search by the players (e.g. corruption, building chains).
-The Three Kingdoms lore and its characters might not appeal to everyone, but as the characters play an important part in the game, I can see how some might be turned off by them.

Alright Total War: THREE KINGDOMS!  Man was I excited about this game,  got myself all hyped and everything.  So first thing is ya this game is great.  Love almost all the Total War games and really enjoy city management and strategic placement of unites buildings and defences games.  Some things to air out right at the start though is this game is not as good as Total Wars recent game Warhammer and Warhammer 2.  If you have not played those games go buy those first and play them (unless your dont like fantasy or something).  I believe that Total War has finally started to start streamlining there style of game and this is the first one were I can honestly say everything is super smooth. 

Pro’s+
Super smooth system and you don’t have to wait for a huge amount of time between your turns like the last 3 total war game’s (Warhammer, Warhammer2 and Rome2) 
Love the choice between having hero’s and not having hero's a great way to balance the game from fantasy to realism.  
So many characters to choose from  with there own unique play style and everything would take me forever to play them all!

Con’s- (pretty big ones)
End game… So as you play you will find out that your can really easily get ruined by the end game as the game kinds turns crazy with everyone going after you basically unless you got lucky and formed a coalition with the right people who did not get too powerful. 
Army reinforcement seems broken.  Sometimes your army's won't help each other out even when everyone really likes each other.  
Corruption in your economy.  Really need your tips to really let you know what that's about and where to see it. 
AI is cheating a little to much.  I understand that the game would not be fun if the enemy could not afford army’s but at end game when 10 factions declare war on your and each rolls in at least 2 army’s and I control half the map but can't afford 6.  Game gets really annoying.

Good game and worth your time!  (if you read this thumb me up or down :)",1561777901,1561777911,True,0.0,True,False,False,370,en

Was pleasantly surprised to find one of the funnest Total War experiences I've had. Up there with Shogun 2 FOTS and Napoleon TW in my books.

Differences from other total wars that make this game better/worse
++Diplomacy feels like the best it's ever been in Total War, the options of how to go about winning are so much broader.
+ Family Trees/Relationships/Governance! After the absolute uninspired garbage that we had for 90% of Rome 2, I was expected something just as lazily done, instead it was the most in depth character system total war has ever had.

-- This is a personal taste feel, but the battles feel so blobby and to me at least (I could just be bad) have very little strategy to them beyond microing units. I just miss the Napoleon and Empire TW battles where you could actually maneouvre and have a strategy beyond blobbing everything together and watching the animations until a side comes out victorious.

I like the new combat feature which is a duel between two generals if you choose Romance mode. Might be not for everyone so you can choose the classic mode.
Improved diplomacy which is more options are available depending on the relationship between yours and other kingdoms.
Beautiful environment graphics. The unit and building models are quite okay.

AIs are okay and sometimes challenging in the beginning depending on the difficulty settings. Just have to outsmart them and do the battles manually but you can't do that for battles on waters though so you can only delegate them.

Troops replenishment is hell here so better position your armies wisely.
The technology tree needs to be revamped though cause it really hurts to look at.
Need more characters' portrait.

The Romance mode offers great Total War Warhammer -style general focused gameplay, where you can sort of roleplay with your characters, giving the better gear etc. to boost their abilities. Game also has the historical mode to offer more realistic gameplay if you're not into supergeneral 1on1 fighting.

It is a bit expensive and the game has some problems, but considering how much Total War games evolve through free patches and paid DLC's you shouldn't really think the game is same during release and after 1-2 years of development.

This review is for people that may have not played a lot of Total War before. I had only a handful of hours in any TW game before this one. Some in Shogun 2, Some in Warhammer, but nothing more than 10 or so hours. Enough to learn that it felt like it would take 500 hours to 'get good' and that while fun, I probably wasn't going to spend that kind of time in it. 

Three Kingdoms was engaging from the start. I've had it for 2 weeks and am approaching 60 hours. Clear quest lines with a much easier-to-navigate UI and campaign/settlement screen were huge for me. Cool general units and unique ancillaries to dish out to your favorites is fun. The graphics and general story setting to the campaign map is amazing. Combat animations and battles seem easier to manage, but I'm not sure much is different from other games in this arena. Trial and error helps a ton, just persist through and you'll have a blast. 

I've completed 2 campaigns in 60 hours on Easy/Normal. First was with Sun Jian, which I found far easier than Cao Cao, and then He Yi in the Yellow Turbans DLC. Both were awesome and played very, very different from each other. A common knock against TK is that all the units are the same. Yes, in battle that is true, but in the campaign screen all factions play differently. Even different generals within the same Faction play differently. The variance is in the campaign, not the unit type. For that reason alone there are hundreds or thousands of hours of replayability here.

The diplomacy does click with me in this one, and in previous games it really didn't. It takes 30-40 hours to feel comfortable initiating or evaluating diplomacy, but I felt like that same time period in previous games was like 100+ hours,  I don't know though I never kept at it long enough. Again, TK is easier on this front and more welcoming. 

I highly recommend Three Kingdoms to any less experienced Total War player. It's a very well-rounded experience. 

+Cool Elements to Color System, works like Strengths vs Weaknesses
+Factions play different from each other
+Graphics are amazing, just zoom and floating around the campaign map is very cool
+Music is great, the entire setting is far, far cooler and more engaging than anticipated
+Turns cycle quicker than Warhammer, just less factions I guess? TK feels like quicker/tighter experience because of this
+++Hooked me where other TW games did not

China is cool, and all the effort put into the Chinese everything is very impressive, and very fun to turn on the Chinese dialogue options. The campaign gameplay has received some much-needed complexity and cool mechanics, building on the Rome 2 system with additions like population complexities, and for the first time since Rome 1 having a coherent, functional, and fun Crusader Kings-like family tree/marriage/faction management system.

But oh man. Oh man oh man oh man.

The battles... maybe it's just me, but they ain't great. Warhammer (understandably) simplified a lot of the tactical combat, but that simplified and frankly arcadey flow feels out of place here, even in the larger-than-life Romance mode. For the first time in a long time, Yoda's back with his army of clones, which is super jarring after all the work that was put in way back in Medieval 2 to have so much dynamic variation between individual men in a unit.

Town/siege battles just... suck. Again, Warhammer simplified them, and while Three Kingdoms does away with the 2-dimensional wall assault style of Warhammer, that simplified philosophy is still painfully present. Magic super-towers pew-pew the attackers to death while you fight in boring and predictable blobs at pre-set chokepoints that you can't even interact with. Gone are Rome 2's complex fortification system and tactical town layouts; now there's just a few set barricade positions that you click on, and they're pretty useless in their pre-set locations. Tedious and uninteresting.

Troop replenishment is absolute torture. While I'm not sad to see some of the ridiculous troop regen from Warhammer gone, now it's too far in the opposite direction, at least in the cases I saw. I think I was in danger of my generals dying of old age before my units would have replenished to full strength. Turn after turn after turn has to be spent just clicking end turn so you can get pathetic handfuls of extra crappy militia troops. I like the return of Britannia's more natural recruitment systems, but it's just painful to interact with in Three Kingdoms.

Some stuff just makes no sense whatsoever. I was BFFs with my faction heir, but in a bad spot for cash, so I decided to take the satisfaction hit and get some extra money from one of the management options. Still BFFs, but now instantly in a civil war for... some reason. Oh, and the general who made up 50% of my (badly depleted, slowly replenishing) army just sort of randomly and arbitrarily appears in my former faction heir's rebel army instead... with fully-replenished, full strength troops! I guess treason makes for good recruitment drives.

The worst sin is the visual presentation in general. For some reason they decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely reinvent the UI and visual style of the series they've been using since Empire, and not for the better. The game is physically painful in terms of finding and reading information that you want or need. I've compared Total War unit stats a thousand times, meticulously checking Melee Attack and Charge Bonus and everything else to figure out what I'm doing... not so easy in Three Kingdoms, on account of the unit stat panel COMPLETELY LACKING DESCRIPTIVE TEXT OF ANY KIND. It's just a noisy mess of incoherent little symbols and stat bars, in complete defiance of the simple, sensible statline readout of every Total War, ever.

That's just one particularly irritating example. The game is lousy with unreadable UI and a frankly kind of ugly presentation. Even the campaign map, which should be a beautiful rendition of China, is kind of lacking compared to Warhammer, and mostly reliant on cheap filters and other post-processing effects to create a visual style. The campaign UI tries a few interesting new ideas but mostly fails, managing to be both ugly and hard to determine what exactly you're looking at. Menus and screens, while in some cases benefiting from a more artistic presentation than just some dry spreadsheet of information, are often obnoxious to find and then subsequently decipher.

So much of the game consists of real, objective steps directly backward in comparison to the rest of the series. Warhammer, despite some of its flaws and simplifications, represented a massive re-invigoration and advancement of the series in so many ways, with Warhammer 2 arguably being CA's best work to date. Three Kingdoms, by contrast, is a mess of ideas, some good, but too many that are stumbling around in an incoherent drunken stupor.",1561761295,1561761505,False,0.5,True,False,False,828,en

The game is set in the period immediately after the fall of the Han empire, where different kingdoms are fighting to decide who will rule over china.

Honestly the game is hard and requires some careful thinking from the beggining, you will have to decide how and when to find your allies and which cities to take over from the enemies without exposing yourself too much. Now that is the simple side of the game, there are hundreds of variables that will determine many characteristics of your ongoing game, from what equipment your generals carry, what skills they have and also who they are favourable to, to even who will they will marry. 

The game is played over a map of ancient china, where you will decide your tactics, when a battle is carried out you can decide to let your general manage the battle or to do it yourself as if it was a real time strategy game, as the game is mostly played by turns (seasons).

 3K doesn't leave a lot to be desired. It is truly a unique game and I am really enjoying my experience with it so far. The Chinese setting feels really unique and new and I had no problem immersing myself into the game. The campaign map is super beautiful, along with the rest of the game. They devs really did a number on diplomacy and I have no complaints. It feels so much more in-depth and you're really given the liberty of doing whatever you want. It doesn't feel so one-dimensional anymore like in their previous titles. Tons of unique characters and my favorite addition, family trees. I'm a sucker for more RP elements like that. Combat for sure doesn't feel as epic as TW:WH/WH2 but that's to be expected in a semi-historically accurate game. I wouldn't say the units are lacking though. The game still allows for multiple ways to win a battle and the units feel pretty balanced with not one combo being the right answer. So you're really free as to where you want to focus. I have plenty like and love with this game and it's replay-ability on par with the rest of the TW series. 
Negatives, well there are a few hiccups in this game. It's still a new release so in time they'll be smoothed out so I'm not worried. Not game braking but definitely annoying like the random declarations of war or some people can't have babies.

TW has made a habit of releasing unfinished titles and forcing the modding community to do the job for them. This feels less like that. Its a solid addition to the series, and honestly is a lot of fun to watch, especially with the blood expansion.
The duels in mid battle are exceptionally fun, as now you feel you have a connection to your generals in a way you didnt before.
The combat mechanics are solid, a few balance adjustments are still needed but overall its good.

My only complaint is one that I have had for every TW ever... I really wish the diplomacy was more detailed, and that I had more control over trading details, and the creation of trade power and creating a trade empire, not just a military might.
It would be great to see this game take a turn to be more like Europe Universalis and Crusader Kings in the economic and ruling an empire end of things, adn maintain the TW feel for combat.
If the TW studio could figure a way to merge those titles dynamics of empire ruling into their combat systems, and keep it multiplayer... they would be creating the greatest empire games of all time.

Diplomacy is actually viable now and you can win campaigns with it alone.  

The battles are fun and look great.  

Units have formations that are both useful and aesthetically pleasing.  

Army composition has been reworked to the retinue system which I like very much.  So armies now can have 3 generals each that can recruit certain types of units that are color coordinated to match each general.  This allows for buffs for said units from said generals.  It's a very pleasant addtion to the game.

Army supplies have been added so enemy armies can't just roam your lands for the entire campaign.

From siege layouts to arrow spams to cavalry speed and unit command, there's an astonishingly heavy amount of screwed up mechanics that shouldn't exist in the 200th Total War game. I can put the game on fast forward and everything still moves like it's in slow motion and watching the unit numbers drop is more painful than watching grass grow. It's so fun to see units just sit there after I told them to do something  so then the game becomes a ragefest where I mash right click in fast forward mode and see blobs of garbage peon soldiers clash for days in heavily biased siege arenas. 

As for the campaign, some people make vassals and coalitions like STDs in a whore house while I'm getting attacked by everyone. There is so much that can go wrong in a turn therein making every move and political decision important. As a noob, it takes a while to get a footing with understanding and implementation of a kingdom. The game is very strict with city upkeep, commander happiness, money bank and army movement and faction goals.

Besides all that, a few bugs and awkward events make the game still seem new and in need of touch ups. It's still the most fun total war game I've played. I like the generals and seeing them fight and have an impact on the world besides just looking pretty surrounded by bodyguards. 

In furtherance I've always known Creative Assembly to have the absolute worst coders in game history and this 3 kingdoms is no difference. The only fun part about this game is the experience of what Koei came out with as Dynasty Warriors, and the story from the Chinese novel.

Game is really good, looks quite nice (though tries to overheat PC a bit and caused several total freezes before patches). Unit diversity is less than I wanted (only 1 artillery option is disappointing, when I've heard about China setting, first thought was about rockets), but really better than Shogun 2 and cavalry is finally viable/musthave. Diplomacy got a bit better and may be useful when you finally learn names of factions. Espionage got more interesting, now you must think whom you're hiring and your spies may become total failure (mostly) or help you a lot, if you're lucky.

Things I like:
Graphics look really nice.
Generals' faces are distinct and reflect their personality really well.
Units won't lose their experience even if they sustained heavy casualty.
Diplomatic manipulations are much more profound.
the campaign map is HUGE, city building and economic development are seriously fun in this game.
As a total war fan and a Chinese, how can I don't love this game?

Things I dislike:
Too few units, I was like using militias all the way. Where are the crossbow cavalries? Also, no horse armor?
I won't play with the romance mode on. It's weird to see a single general slaying hundreds of man with ease while taking heavy arrow fire. It's not realistic. It's a nice try but that's not for me.

Pros: 
-Diplomacy is great and there are consequences for betrayal, for loyalty and inter-personal relations are at an all time high.
-Combat is exciting and I still find myself impressed by the insane sizes of some of these battles using the large army battle option and extreme unit size. 15k+ troops fighting it out in a desperate brawl for survival has never been so fun.
-Extremely easy to pick up and play
-Building browser is easy to access and use
-New styles of play are introduced with unique mechanics for different factions which keeps the game fresh.
- You can become rather attached to your favorite characters and I was legit pissed at Shi Hui for abandoning my coalition and attacking Chang'an in the same turn. Sun Ce was stationed there briefly and he died in the fighting. (I play records mode, so chars are not gods) I went on a revenge rampage and sacked all of their settlements 2-3 times, killing Shi Hui and 2 other following faction leaders. It was quite satisfactory.

Cons:
-Maps can get rather stale quite fast. Cities all look similar, and walls fall apart faster than wet paper towels. sieges have few options at the moment and need some diversity in map design and ways of attacking/defending. Although I greatly appreciate the wall artillery.
-Bugs are still present: Babies are rarely born, didn't have a single one born during my Sun Jian Campaign, archers tend to charge even when on guard mode which has caused some irritation, AI seem to desire war with me far more than other AI (despite my trustworthiness) And in records mode, during sieges in snow everything turns green for some reason, which is an odd one. 

TLDR: Yes, is good, and while bugs are present they are rather minimal. Game is beautiful, the art style is inspired and fresh. Map diversity is lacking though.",1561520750,1561520750,True,0.0,True,False,False,348,en

Many problems in Single Player campaign that need to be adressed ASAP. But to me personally the biggest disappointment is the balancing which is almost not existent and the multiplayer part which can only be described with a four letter word I may not use here.

I'd say they've changed the campaign more  in this installment than in any previous installment.  What's different?  Recruitment, construction, income, diplomacy, upkeep, replenishment, research, characters, royal court, administration, rebellions, spying, items, trade, win conditions, AI behavior, and more stuff too.  Basically every change is an improvement.  Diplomacy is the best I've ever seen in a TW installment, for sure.

The voice work is excellent too.  I could be wrong, but it sounds to me like they hired native speakers of Chinese to voice most or all of the game.  The accents sound very authentic.  One feature I'd LOVE in this game is a menu tab where you can listen to a native speaker pronounce all the stuff in the game (all the character names and locations).  Chinese is such a cool language.

One letdown to me is the unit variety.  I guess it's hard to stack up against the awesome variety in Warhammer: TW.  Compared to monsters, chariots, eagles, and wizards flinging meteors and summoning zombies, of course armies composed entirely of humans and horses are going to feel a little subdued.  But I think the variety feels weaker than a lot of their previous historical games as well.  No throwing weapons, no elephants, no naked dudes with warpaint, no greatsword berserkers in bathrobes (looking at you, Shogun 2), no female soldiers (though plenty of female generals), no pikes, cannons, camels, whips, guns, caltrops, or poison.  No specialist units devoted to hunting generals.  No teleportation.  No naval combat.

The battles do work very well, don't get me wrong.  One change is that morale plays an ever bigger role than ever before, in my opinion.  It's easier than ever to rout enemy units without killing them, using morale shocks, rear charges, character skills, and special abilities like Scare and Fire Arrows.  Countering these with carefully-placed elite units to anchor your lines, as well as screening cavalry and morale-boosting characters, will all be very important, especially in multiplayer.

Another thing I'm not sure about is the Romance mode.  I thought I'd like it since I'm a fantasy lover and I liked how the special characters worked in Warhammer.  But some of the generals ( I guess specifically the campaign special characters) are just over the top.  I recruited Lu Bu and he can seriously win battles by himself.  He effortlessly racks up hundreds of kills every time I field him.  The strategists and commanders work pretty well, but I think the sentinels, champions, and vanguards could maybe use some toning down?  I guess this is more a balance issue than a core problem with the game.  The Duel feature is a little goofy too.  Not sure exactly how it could be improved.  Of course they thoughtfully include the Records mode, which I might try for my next campaign.

I haven't tried the multiplayer battles yet.  I really loved the multiplayer in Shogun 2, so I might give this a shot soon.  I also haven't tested the multiplayer campaigns.  Maybe I'll update my review once I do.

Overall, an excellent installments in the TW franchise.  Best campaign mechanics by far.  My favorite installment?  Hm.",1561382350,1561382350,True,0.0,True,False,False,538,en

For years I have wanted a game set in China as there is  a wealth of history and excitement to explore.  I cheered with joy when I saw the first announcement for 3 kingdoms.

I could barely wait as the release got closer and closer only for me to fail heavily.  

The problem.  

The damn thing doesn't work.

I'm running an i7-7700K, Geforce RTX 2080TI, and 32gb of RAM so my rig can definitely handle it, but I get crashes and BSOD left and right.  IRQL not less or equal, Kmod exception, the game just isn't reliable for me.

The problems continue to mount up for the game as factions demand you join a war, you agree and then in the next turn, they sign a peace deal - leaving you exposed in the war. This impacts trade and food which would finish you off - unless you are the AI, you can survive on -17 food forever it appears and still not see any uprisings or rebellions in its territory.

The generals can collect pieces of armour, weapons and boost effects to make them stronger in combat and looks like a desperate attempt at microtransactions in the future. This help your generals in combat against other Generals should you wish to engage in a duel.

+Diplomacy is the best of any TW. I think this is a new bar for future games. It's genuinely interesting to play the politics game in your favor for once. Certainly makes it unique to most other TW games. Hopefully these changes become standard. 

+Runs well and looks great. Art style is fantastic but that of course is subjective. Battles are smooth and look beautiful (I recommend night battles+fire arrows+forest). I like the soundtrack, but again, that's subjective. 

+The choice between Romance and realism modes are welcome. I was worried initially this game might be trying to combine lords from Warhammer with a historical game haphazardly but I was wrong. I quite enjoyed Romance mode, characters have a real presence on the field and in diplomacy. Lu Bu is a one man death machine, Cao Cao will backstab you with diplomacy etc. 

+Speaking of characters this is the first historical TW game where I could actually remember characters that weren't in my direct family line. Setting them up with special weapons and armor, watching their friendships and rivalries evolve over time...it's a nice splash of RPG mechanics without getting in the way. You can completely ignore it if you wish. Personally I enjoyed rewarding my champion with a fancy new spear and horse after he mopped the floor with all three opposing generals. 

+Trebuchets. So much death. What can the Han do against such reckless flaming 90kg projectiles within 300 meters?

Cons: 

-Building chains are a bit basic. Match your colors and you're basically set. The buildings themselves also don't unlock new units as in previous games. Not quite sure how I feel about that, but it leads me to my next point.

-Unit recruitment is obtuse. It's not well explained what commanders can recruit which specific units. Some are tied to reforms. Some are only available to high level commanders. Some are both. I've read a breakdown of it online and I still can't keep it straight. Said units also do not vary all that much. Pretty basic rock-paper-scissors. This is definitely a game about characters first, which might turn some people off. 

-Commanders are effectively useless in Romance mode. They give unit buffs but they can't hang in combat as well as a vanguard and they can't fight other generals as well as a duelist or sentinel. The best thing they bring to the table is anti-missle cav...the basic unit version of which is available to everyone. 

Overall, I would recommend this game. If you are really unsure maybe wait for a sale, but certainly pick it up when you can.",1561124564,1561124564,True,0.0,True,False,False,434,en

I love the new spy network feature, but you don't even need to use it and the AI never uses it on you. So it feels like a nifty idea but you could the entire game without knowing it was there.

Normal campaigns, mind you, as I have never seen the point nor want to have to deal with a cheating AI (anymore then it already is) that comes about on the higher difficulty sections. I like it, its a unique setting, the diplomacy is the best in any total war game ever, and while simplistic the settlement management does require you to put thought into it. As for the battles, there pretty on par with most total war games.

But, it has some problems, a-lot of them in fact, the list is very, very long.

1. The Factions. Most of them are extremely similar, bar the yellow turbans, your going to be basically doing the same shtick regardless of whatever faction you play. They overrely on the unique faction mechanics, and those without them end up feeling bland and uninteresting. As for the units...

2. Armies/Units. Unit variety is non-existent, in all most all my campaigns so far Ive always ended up using the same composition. Spear guard/Jian sword guard with raider cavalry/Jian sword guard cavalry finished off with crossbows and one piece of artillery. Theres no incentive to make recruit any other kind of unit. Unique units are way too overpriced for what they provide, and by the time you can afford them usually your militia army is so experienced that theres no point in upgrading. Bow units are made redundant by crossbows as the later has better range and dps. Infantry are just meat shields, barely capable of getting anything above 50 kills, and cavalry is brokenly overpowered, deleting infantry on the charge if they're not braced spearmen. As for heroe's,  they can range from being the most powerful unit in your army to losing to a single unit of Ji Militia, abilities are over powered and can carry a battle (e.g when I used Lu bu's I once got him up to 2000 kills just by spamming his rage ability and cycle charging) 
and duels roughly boil down to ""who's ability connects"" wins or who has the better equipment wins. As for the characters themselves...

3. Heroes. They're kinda janky. You have no control over thier traits, so if they get one and now thier fellow generals hate them well then your outta luck. Some of thier abilies are garbage (such as the will of the forest or hamstring) while others are necessary (Binding fury, unyielding earth, tenacity of steel, stone bulwark). The rest of thier talents roughly follow the same categories. Ive barely seen half of the unique characters in the game, half of which are held by the han empire, and capture rate is so low that I can rarely ever get them on my side. Which ones appear in your recruitment pool is purely determined by your faction leaders traits (along with a great amount of luck) and most of the time your armies will be comprised of the generic type. Speaking of generic, most ""legendary characters"" are just the generic ones with unique models, same abilities, same talents etc. If they game drags out for too long then they'll die of old age as well, for such a character driven story you'd think years would be more then just 4 turns. Speaking of which...

4. Campaign length. They are short, like, very short, my current record for shortest victory is 80 turns. (20 Ingame Years) Three kingdoms has the shortest campaign yet. Assuming things are going well that is, you'll be firing off the three kingdoms event as early as turn 50, and from there winning is as easy as besieging your opponents capital (and if its a assured victory) they will abdicate to you diplomatically and confederate with you. Ive yet to even get 50% of the reforms, and they take so long to get that by the time you get access to the cool epic dragon unit youve usually already won. While were on the topic of reforms...

5. The tech tree. Yes, it looks cool, but you're never going to get most of it. You are given the illusion of choice in deciding which reforms to pass, and by that I mean that youre going to spend the first 5 to get the 10% replenishment bonus, as without it can take 2-2.5 in game years before your army is at full strength, were in china btw. after that your gonna need to get the 15% movement bonus to help you get around and intercept enemy armies, and by the time you get that you gonna have to go into the yellow economic line to increase your income and counter corruption. Which by this point should be around 60% and mudering your income, and by the time I reached that point I won my campaign. Theres no way to increase the rate at which you get reforms, so your pretty much forced to get the same stuff over and over again. 

5.5 corruption. Oh God, its back, and its bad, own barely a fourth of the map, half your income goes up in smoke, you really have to manage it, or else your screwed. Wish school's reduced corruption, then they'd actually be somewhat useful.

6. Diplomacy. This is the most praised aspect of three kingdoms, and while its certainly a huge step up from what we had before, it still has a couple problems. Im sure youve all seen the youtube videos about becoming the ""rice mafia"", and to a point, it highlights the issues with diplomacy. Deals with the Ai can range from horrifically in thier favor to comepletely in yours. Ye old, suicidal Ai is back too, and they wont ever accept peace unless you destory thier army or give them half your land. Thier factions ""nature"" doesn't actually matter, ""underdog' vassals will always betray you while your enemies vassal swarm will make you want to rage quit faster then when Dong zhou gets murdered. ""peaceful"" guys will declare war for no reason, Ai forgets that vassals have masters and will bite off waaaay more then they can chew and be annoying. Coalitions and alliances work though, so its not all bad I guess. While were on the note of the Ai...

7. Ar derp der hur sorry I was just trying to mimic intellegence. The Ai, while not rome 2 launch bad, is still not exactly Sun tzu. Controlling your enemies army with your cavalry is stupidly easy allowing you to shoot them with impunity and or pick of stray units. As per usual they have a leg up on you when it comes to reaction times and, as per usual, they have wall hacks. Good luck launching any kind of tactics when the ai place a quarter of thier units on top of a artillery piece while the rest run ahead suicide themselves against your battleline, so when you try to send one of your guerilla deployed cavalry to snipe out the artillery through the forest carefully not to reveal it at any point so that when it reachs the artillery it can get out but no itll get dogpilled and destroyed and they's no feasible way the ai could have known that you did do that unless they're fog of war is disabled and they can see everything. And yes, I was very salty. On the campaign map its much of the same, the ai keeping three armies on one settlement ready to jump your ass the moment you attack, placed they're ahead of time, that you'd have no way of seeing unless you had a scout- OH WAIT.

8. Espionage, more Esp and nag then anything else. Its dumb, random, situationally usefull but otherwise I rarely use it. If your lucky then you might be able to get a settlement for free or something, probably not, it takes to long for them to set up networks and get enough cover that by that time you've probably already conquered them normally. Overall, it kinda redundant.

9. Minor gripes/stuff. Im almost done, heres just a small list of stuff I dislike that arnt really important that I havnt touched on yet.

a. Why does the cruel trait decrease public order by 4?? thats insane, I hope you like rebelions cuz your gonna get alot of em.
b. Ambush success chance/capture chance is calculated and is done on the turn before anything happens, save scumming doesn't work.
c. Why do farmlands and livestock villages have no towers????
d. why does it cost so much to reclaim settlements???

1. ""The Art Style Sucks"" - Personally, I love the art style, it's perfectly impressionistic and fits the ""romance"" mood perfectly. Although, one of the first things I did after an hour or so of playtime was disable Depth of Field (DOF) in the graphics settings, after that it's beautiful

2. ""The End Game is a Slog"" - Yes, it's true, the game grows really grindy and complex in the late game. But, this has been true of literally every total war game ever, and this game isn't as bad as most previous titles, so if you're a fan of Total War, then you know what to expect and shouldn't be surprise. In particular I don't understand the people praising Warhammer, the end game there is 10x grinder and sloggier than this game.

3. ""The AI Sucks"" - Okay, let me ask you something. What's the point of including a mechanic in a video game, and then programming the AI to perfectly avoid/counter that mechanic, thereby rendering the mechanic utterly pointless to exist? Obviously the AI is programmed to make mistakes like charging Cav into spear walls, etc. Total War is supposed to be both a macro and a micro game. They could address this maybe by changing the AI's behavior according to difficulty level, but personally I play on normal and I like watching battlefield tactics actually work against the AI. If I want to fight a punishingly difficult AI, I'll go play Grandmaster Chess or Dark Souls or something.

4. ""There's No Unit Diversity / Unit Balance is Off"" - Also partially true, but not really that bad for a new release. Melee infantry balance seems off, especially with Ji infantry being basically good against everything and axe / sword infantry being basically poor against everything, but they all have their uses and with a little tweaking I think it will work. Sword Cavalry seems a tad OP, at least because the basic Tier 1 Sword Cav Milita just owns everything early game and it's not really that expensive. But in terms of unit cost, yes, the units get dramatically more expensive for relatively minor stat increases. Why? Well if you're playing the macro game well, upkeep / recruitment cost should not be the limiting factor on your armies, you will fill all of your general / army slots and still have more money than you can spend on cheap units, so why not hire more expensive ones?

5. ""Faction Balance / Diversity is Off"" - Eh, I will admit, many of the starting faction's ""Special Abilities"" seem sorta undercooked / pointless. For Example, Cao Cao's special buildings seemed (to me at least) far worse than their standard counterparts, but maybe they're geared to a particular playstyle / strategy I just haven't discovered yet. Wu has the ability to hire Mercenaries, but they're basically just highly expensive garbage tier units whose only advantage is immediate recruitment time vs waiting 3-5 turns. Almost never worth it. However the mercenary building does fit nicely into the faction's commerce-based macro game. But the way I look at it, the faction specialties are meant to offer opportunities to play the game from a different, probably less-than-optimal style, just to experiment with, which is fine. You can still win with any faction.

6. ""Hero Generals Are Dumb"" - Lol, and Warhammer was better? Half the units in those games are basically legendary / hero units, so every battle literally just turns into the giants / dragons / steamtanks or whatever on either side obliterating 90% of each sides armies, then dukeing it out to decide the winner after both armies are reduced to 1/10th of a stack. Three Kingdoms actually has interesting RPG elements, and even in Romance mode, the hero's are really not OP, they can definitely be countered even by normal units.

In conclusion, I think most of the bad reviews are either disappointed Warhammer Fans or a niche audience who are looking for some kind of tremendously difficult game with mechanically perfect AI. I loved Empire, Napoleon, and Shogun 2, and this game has revived my interest in the Total War series after a long period of lackluster releases that didn't quite do it for me.",1561000199,1561000199,True,0.48505905270576477,True,False,False,734,en

Pro:
- Playstyle for each factions differs, make the game very replayable.
- The historical setting is considered to be fan-favorite among East-Asian Countries
- Campaign AI is smart and challenging, since weak faction would likely form coalition, and bigger factions vassalize other small nation. Players have to make good use of the diplomacy system and not getting isolated by other factions.
- Diplomacy offers many options for players  in dealing  (e.g. trade food, trade money, trade wifes, trade accessories, trade territories...)
- Flexibility on gameplays. offers fictional romance mode, and realistic records mode. Although I prefer the Records mode, since the Generals on romance mode is very much OP can single handedly take over several group of armies, making game vs AI very easy, but that's just me, some Dynasties Warrior fans may like the latter.
- New spy system - may use it to backstab other factions
- Largest map todate
- The disk requirement is very small!!! only 20 GB, yet the graphics reminded me of a Shogun 2 on steriods.

Cons:
- No naval battles
- The building system is way way too simple. No strategies to it, just build one building of each type for each settlement.
- Battle AI is too simple, even on harder difficulties (except Legendary).
- AI tends to prioritize defeating you, making campaigns unrealistic.
- Differenet types of generals can only recruit their respective armies, making army building unflexible.",1560830455,1560830455,True,0.5454545617103577,True,False,False,283,en

One of the best Total Wars to date in my opinion.  I've been playing since Medieval 1 and this is the only Total War that makes Diplomacy feel like it actually matters.  Very good graphics and lighting.  Best campaign out of any Total War in terms of meaningful choices and consequences.  The RPG like stats of your generals make you actually care about them again tho not as much as you would have in Rome 1 or Medieval 2 (unless you have the legendary generals.  You might know about them from history or even games like Dynasty Warriors)

The battles are solid and I've had some of my most memorable and epic battles in Three Kingdoms.  I see a lot of complaints saying the game isn't complex or doesn't have unit variety but then those same people turn around and rate Shogun 2 or Warhammer 2 as one of the best, if not the best, Total War of all time.  I enjoyed Shogun 2 tremendously but it had even less unit variation and the campaign was a joke compared to Three Kingdoms especially with the Realm Divide Mechanic.  Warhammer 2 might have some of the absolute best battles and crazy amounts of diversity but it's campaign is an absolute joke and probably the worst out of any Total War game.  Some people may like that but the way I see it is that the campaign in Warhammer is just extra padding in between battles but unfortunately that makes campaign battles carry much less weight.

All in all one of my favorite Total Wars since Medieval 2.  Some of the most interesting and dynamic campaigns I've ever had in a Total War game.

Only complaints are the AI cheating and having tons of stacks when you can only afford 1 (but thats in like every Total War game) and they force march everywhere but can run away if you catch them in force march whereas in past total wars with that mechanic you would get ambushed if caught in that stance and could not retreat.  This results in enemy armies just running around your territory being almost uncatchable doing as they please. Your only choice is to constantly chase them and hope to back them into a corner or pincer them with a second army or to just ignore them and hope that they don't do too much damage.

I never really got fully invested in a Total War game, but this is one is amazing.  I was never super into Chinese history, but this is so well done it's gotten me really interested in the period.

The battles are done very well too. A lot of battles you don't think you can win, but if you watch some good players on YouTube you can come up with cool strats and pull out seemingly impossible wins.

Every game also comes out so differently in terms of alliances, the way things end up shaking out etc.

I haven't enjoyed a game so much since Civ VI.

The only caveat I have is that it is addictive AF. 

Couldn't recommend this game enough if you like strategy games, even if you aren't a Total War fan.

Now bring on the blood and gore DLC! I don't even care if it's paid. The game is worth more than $60 anyway, and I normally hate paid DLC.",1560782410,1560782410,True,0.0,True,False,False,177,en

At the time of this review, there are many issues with the game which take away much of the experience for me, but I want to focus on four of them:

1. You cannot marry between factions more than once. They AI may purpose a second marriage but the terms are set and you cannot alter them. This means if you want more that one character or want to ensure a strong relationship over the years, tough luck, CA decided for no legit reason that you can't.
Edit: turns out you CAN do it more than once, but it takes some trickery. First you have to IMMEDIATELY divorce the character you just got, don't give them a chance to have kids. Then promote them 3-4 times so they don't get pissed and leave because this just happened to them. Then you can get another. The reasoning by the game engine is that if someone from one family is present in another, they can't marry in because everyone is related, even though only one character is blood related.

2. Ancient Chinese Cheetah-men. By this I mean they decided that charging infantry can chase down fleeing horses. Now if the horses are in red fatigue and it's over a short distance, I can understand. But yellow fatigue horses being chased down for over 3 minutes? NO, stupid dumb and limits the use of cav because if the player is smart, their first charge is their last, in which case, why bother with a 1 shot unit when I can deploy glaives?

3. Abysmal character event rates. For those who don't already know, No faction starts with more than 3 unique (those with portraits and armor) characters (Sun family not really being an exception because all 3 are kids at the start). This is ok, but characters who are suppose to join your faction, or who were suppose to already be serving according to history, are set by ""random events"" to join you without hassle. What does this mean? It means Dian Wei might never join Cao Cao, despite the fact that he was scooped up by him before the battle of Hu Lao gate. Now when I say might, I mean WILL, because the trigger rate for these events is something crazy low, possibly less than 1% (250/50000 according to a reddit poster). This is very annoying, and it leads to some characters not appearing in most campaigns, leaving one to wonder why CA even bothered besides to make people like me angry?

4. Most damning is the aging system (to clarify, I much prefer romantic mode). Of course characters should grow old and eventually die, this isn't warhammer anymore. But all unique characters are in the game from turn 1, meaning there's a set amount of time before china is filled with generic losers who just aren't fun to play as because all the uniques die of old age. This could be EASILY solved if they decided to include more characters from the later ages like Wen Yang, but they chose not to. Every time I stop expanding to develop my lands, time flies by and characters who were in their 40's are now dying of old age. There is only Sun Ren who is almost guaranteed to survive until the end, and that's because she's 1 at the start of the game and isn't useable until turn 85. It's because of her that I have problem 1 in the first place because I want all the Sun kids so I have interesting generals for most of my campaign, instead of generic portrait 7 in the late game.",1560758645,1561524897,False,0.42424240708351135,True,False,False,633,en

I've bought most recent game in the series just to play tactical battles and historical scenarios, but this is the first time the strategic campaign mode has really drawn me in for the long haul. The campaign mode allows for a depth of player interaction and diplomatic maneuvering, worthy of comparison with grand strategy titles like those made by Paradox Development Studio.

Conceptually, Three Kingdoms is a good mixture of historical sim and fantasy elements: I really like the extra bit of variety you get by switching between the fantasical Romance mode and the more traditional Records mode. Speaking of variety, I didn't expect much from the day-one Yellow Turban Rebellion DLC, but it turned out to be a huge addition with a massively different playstyle and technology system from the main game factions, as well as some of the most challenging starts currently available in-game. As it was a free preorder/first-week bonus that adds something unique and exciting to the existing game experience, it feels like an example of release-day DLC done right.

My issues are relatively minor and can be fixed by minor adjustments in future patches. The diplomacy is a massive improvement on previous games but it needs a few tweaks: other characters will annoyingly offer the player a false choice in coalition deals that the target AI already won't accept. This would be fine if all members were already agreed to such a deal except for the player. It's also possible for the player to easily take advantage of the AI in diplomacy by canceling promised payments, but that's to be expected and the biggest exploits are likely be addressed with balance patches.

Performance is surprisingly decent considering this is the gaming rig I built to match the Total War Rome 2 recommended specs way back when that game first came out. Other than a slowdown glitch in siege battles that is familiar from previous Total War games, I've had no performance issues on medium settings. The glitch is easily resolved by repositioning units that are standing in the dynamic wall breaches, so it would seem the problem is actually with pathfinding and not with graphics processing.

As many other reviewers have noted, the game is visually splendorous, even on medium settings. Like the tactical battles, it can be varied up by switching between Romance and Records visual styles, separately from the gameplay setting. The character art for the main heroes is really well done, though of course I'd like for just a few more minor characters to have their own unique graphics. The DLC roadmap that they've announced seems like it's likely to address my concern there, with the characters introduced in alternative start dates.

I should finally note that the writing in the game is an especially big draw! The dialogue, narration, and text events are all enormous contributors to the immersion in the game's setting, and these are the main thing I miss now when going back to earlier Total War titles. I like that voices can be swapped between English and Mandarin Chinese, with separate options for the narrator, hero units, and AI faction leaders.

It is quite similar to other total war series in terms of battlefield gameplay, if you played a total war game before you won't find anything special here, especially if you have played Warhammer. The best part of this game is perhaps the diplomacy (still plagued with ridiculous demands). 

In this game, the AI is very active with you they constantly ask you to do something, it could be buying stuffs or agents from you or ask you to join an alliance. In past titles the AIs do not really talk to you unless you are ten times more powerful than them and even if they do they are limited with the options they have, such as Non-aggression pact, trade and war. 

The AI will actually ask to become your vassal if there is no hope for them to win against you. In past titles Ai would fight to the death, at least in my experience. In my opinion, the best part of the diplomacy is that no one can be trusted. The AIs are constantly switching alliances and when you are in an alliance everyone is constantly trying to kick someone out. Which is quite hilarious. For example, A is trying to kick b, b is trying to kick D and C is trying prevent A from being kicked by D.

But I do find the fighting animations in this game to be not as good as warhammer. Soldiers are sometimes hitting air like in Attila, most apparent when fighting generals.
The cavalry charge animation on impact feels weak like the soldiers fall before the cavalry hits them.

I’m very glad I did. First things first, day one DLC ...... Not cool CA. [PLEASE STOP]

Now that's out of the way, this is a great game that feels one of the strongest on launch I have seen. I love the leader’s system. I wish marriage was a bigger deal and more fleshed out, but overall an amazing step. [ Rome 3 Cough**]

The combat to me feels great, I feel the leader to troop ratio of kills is good and being able to equip them with weapons is mint! I adore the RPG additions with this title. The leaders are unique and have hard starts. I start on VH, H most Total Was, not today Jimmy. 

Not today. 

The yellow Turban are fun, I like the old-style Tec map! But i do find with have 6 unique lords [Of the top of my head] they do start to feel a little limited towards owning half the map. On the other hand, they offer something of a ""This is total war"" [Legend] style campaign. From my understanding though CA said they would leader packs in earlier or later time frames, didnt 6 years before a cloaked badass MF with his brothers walk around?

As an Englishman, I hope we can find understanding that i like islands. I can’t build an empire with those three tiny little islands CA! (I would love to see future Korea DLC'S (im not 100% sure of their history at this time but map wise it would be a game changer). 

I think the banners in particular make the game look so much better than other titles, in fairness the game looks great. I find it hard to escape the Dynasty Warriors look, but CA did a amazing Job. I think the artwork deserves a round of applause.

But, holy crap- CA has done it again. They made a product that is engaging, fun, and unique throughout every gameplay mechanic. Three Kingdoms does a masterful job of making you feel as if you're a leader trying to create a name for their family and faction in the vast sea that is Three Kingdoms China. 

New mechanics add a layer of depth that the Total War series was lacking.  From the characters you put in your armies according to the ""harmony/disharmony mechanic"" to receive stat bonuses for campaign and battle maps, to the governorship's you might appoint according to those that are loyal and industries, but might not be the best warriors for the front-lines. This makes characters feel unique with their own backstory- all explored through the easy to navigate UI.

Battle Mechanics are solid- as is with most every Total War game. To some of the more historical inclined Total War veterans the battles will feel faster, with most battles being between 5 to 8 minutes- with longer battles coming close to 10 to 12 minutes. This can be off putting to some- but to others it will be a welcome change that makes it less likely of an ""auto-resolve"". The game also runs at a smooth 40 fps with everything on ultra and having over 5,000 units on the battle map.

Meanwhile, the Campaign Map is absolutely gorgeous. From the windy snowy peaks of mountain ranges, to the water lapping on the eastern coastal shores, to the green pastures that change with every season- the map will be a treat to the eyes. I did have a slight issue when scrolled all the way out with some FPS drop- and I know it isn't due to my computer. This can easily be fixed with a later patch as it isn't game breaking- just more of any annoyance.

Three Kingdoms offers solid land combat and siege battles that I have really enjoyed I really like the romance setting of the game which really allows players to invest time into their generals and leadership and then see them perform on the battlefield against other generals in one on one combat.  Hand to hand combat and animations are not the greatest and could use some work.The lack of blood and gore dlc at the beginning was frustrating but I understand why it wasn't included in the base game.

HOWEVER... The lack of naval combat and the amount of crashes is a total disappointment and leaves me feeling like the game is only 2/3 finished. I just have to auto resolve any naval engagement which is ridiculous. The AI and unit variation is basically copied and pasted between factions and every campaign is the same after 50 turns. IF YOU ONLY GIVE PEOPLE 2/3 OF A GAME THEN MAKE IT 2/3 OF THE PRICE. Moreover, I have had about 25 black screen crashes and had numerous other stability issues. 

UPDATE: The last few updates appear to have rectified the problem but I am frustrated by all the band-aid work required because the stability issues weren't worked out prior to release. All in all I would still buy the game (Die hard Total War fan) but never again at full cost. Maybe a 6/10 in my book but hopefully CA and modders can make this game comparable to Rome II or Attila.

Many of the complaints on forums and reviews come because people do not appreciate how important diplomacy is to winning the game. Previous Total War franchises under-emphasized diplomacy, and so long-time players are surprised that their Min-Max build strategy and military don't win the game. Still others seem to think that Legendary difficulty ought to be something other than unfair, win by the skin of your teeth. 

Longer Review:
First, let's get the obvious out of the way. This is not Total War: Warhammer. TW:W and TW:W2 are great games. I still play them a lot. Many Warhammer factions emphasize unique game play that just doesn't make sense in historical settings. At the same time, sometimes you don't want armies with dragons and swirling vortexes of fire. You just want guys with pointy sticks being crushed by rocks and impaled on other pointy sticks. We live in an amazing age where two franchises sit side by side to scratch both those itches. 


The music and visuals in this game are fantastic. The variety of factions is good, and it is really fun to see how location and some small differences between leaders cause a great variety of game play to emerge.

Above all, the Campaign map is the best I've seen since maybe Rome: TW. The TW franchise went through a phase where the campaigns were a chore. You had the strategic map cluttered with all these agents. Engaging in spying, diplomacy and other agent actions required you to spend every turn trying to find that agent on the other side of the map and moving them around. Now, agents have largely been abstracted from the campaign map. Diplomacy and Spying are handled in separate screens, and you don't have to move agents around a map- you just give orders and see stuff happen. This frees up the map to be much more strategy focused.

Spying is really cool- generals are wandering around looking to be hired. They could be a valuable asset to your cause, or they could be under the employ of another faction. You can send one of your agents out to work for another faction. If the enemy faction hires them, they may be placed in different positions- administering territory or leading an army. And in those positions you can cause all sorts of mischief- from messing with trade to poisoning armies. If there is one complaint, it is that when attacking an army with your spy in charge, there is no option to use him/her. I had a high ranking general who I sadly ended up having to kill when the enemy raised an army in a city I was about to attack. 

Diplomacy is finally a thing. Let me be clear: If you are not spending at least as much time in the diplomatic screen as in the building screens, you are going to be in trouble. Many of the negative reviewers miss this point. The diplomacy in this game introduces new trade offs. In previous TW's, you always tried to get a full territory to maximize your prospects. But in this game, it may be better to take pieces of different territories to open up diplomatic contact with others. It may be better to leave that weak faction on one side of you. Trading food and setting up trade deals may earn you more money and allies than a couple armies. At the start of your game, you need to be laser focused on assembling a coalition of factions. If you don't, you'll get about 50-80 turns in and discover that another faction has started vassalizing half the map.

A final point is that 3 Kingdoms is much like the Warhammer franchise in that the turn where you get in trouble is not the turn that you made a mistake. Usually, when those stacks of armies come rolling across your border, it is because of mistakes you made 5 - 10 turns earlier. It takes a bit of time to think through what you could have done to avoid that fate. I have restarted several campaigns specifically because I realized a war was a bad idea, or extending my supply lines was foolish. Usually, your mistakes are in diplomacy. If you aren't constantly building relationships with others, you are going to find yourself one against a dozen enemies.",1560610419,1560610419,True,0.0,True,False,False,742,en

Why? Because while it does fall short in some aspects it is still a Total War experience at heart: a historical game that merges diplomacy in warfare into a great experience. I was not a a fan of TW:WH despite being a warhammer fan because the game felt not only dull but I despise the stupid Dynasty Warriors style crazy general gameplay that rewarded farming XP for that one general so that he/she may be able to literally beat fully stacked armies on their own. Thank you CA for giving us the option to turn that garbage off. Also I apologise for any errors in spelling as English is not my first language.

Pros:
+ The ability to choose between realism (classic, good Total War) and romance (new, less interesting Total War) modes
+ Diplomacy has been reworked and is better than ever! Although there are still instances when you want to just give up due to the entire map declaring war on you because you wanted to force Cao Cao, who had 1 farmland left, to join your confederation...
+ Characters are more fleshed out than ever! Characters now have likes and dislikes, making it matter who commands armies and who is in your government
+ Interesting characters. even the plain generals start to grow on you after a while
+ Campaign mode is amazing thanks to the things mentioned above
+ The ability to choose Mandarin Chinese as voiceover adds immersion  
+ Chinese VA is really damn good!
+ China in Total War? FINALLY! ABOUT DAMN TIME!

Mixed:
+/- Lack of faces and variety for generals. can be fixed in patches
+/- Lack of diversity between units, although to be fair its hard to make it diverse to the all belonging to more or less the same culture. Shogun had the same issue and was still super fun
+/- Lack of general types. There are 4 types of generals in Three Kingdoms, and while they all play a bit differently ithere isnt a  huge difference overall. The Yellow Turban rebellion ads different types but thats a DLC and they are exclusive to the Yellow Turbans. Shame on you CA for not giving us that for free!
+/- Blood and Gore DLC sure to come. Why dont we get that for free?

Cons:
- Battles are still short..
- Battle AI is a joke, managed to defeat 2 fully stacked armies with a local farms garrison
- No naval combat....
- No naval invasions. Why??? One of the greatest battles of the Three Kingdoms era WAS A NAVAL INVASION! Battle of the Red Cliffs
- DAY 1 DLC! F*CK OFF! 
- You can bet your left nut that CA is going to milk DLC for this game...

PS: As a DLC, maybe add some new cultures and expand the map like you did in TW: WH and Shogun 2. Korea and Mongolia would be interesting, albeit not too related to the Three Kingdoms era.

PPS: No Yuan Shao, I do not wanna be your vassal ffs. and no Dong Zhou, I will not be your vassal either. ``",1560601736,1560607349,True,0.0,True,False,False,545,en

I was really hung over at the time of writing and my thoughts were everywhere, so thanks to those that actually bothered reading a really unorganized essay:

I've played Total War since I first got my hands on Rome in grade school, and really enjoy military history/history and social studies as well as RTS. So I'd call myself somewhat of a veteran. MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE TOTAL WAR (Not because I'm a weeb I swear!) Has been Shogun 2 ever since it released. I haven't ended up touching Legendary difficulties for example yet due to this being more of a pasttime game than one of my main games. (I only finished Medieval 2 and Shogun 2) I haven't touched Rome 2, Empire, Napoleon, or Warhammer1/2 yet, either due to priorities or some of these games having shit releases.

Unorganized Summary of my Thoughts:
Best Total War upon release since Shogun 2, has its own issues but they're quickly going to be patched out from the looks of things. I ended up addicted to the campaigns and even started over as different characters several times already. Doesn't look like this one will be plagued by DLC too bad but that's TBA. The diplomacy and a lot of empire management and QoL features really is a step above the previous titles. The game runs pretty smooth and stable on extreme unit size all settings maxed out @1440p on my 1080ti/i7 7700k PC. I'll have to see how I feel about this game after trying Warhammer 2 which is apparently the best modern title to most right now, but it was plagued by a horrible DLC model and I just never ended up playing it yet, likely because I'm more a fan of the historic titles. I think by the time I take a break from this one to actually finish one of the previous Total Wars it'll be even better when I come back. Solid release, some things feel rushed, but definitely trending towards being one of the best Total War games in a long time. I'm also really curious what the DLC and future patches will have in store for us past the initial patches which will probably make this game more than worth it. 

My Issues/more organized:
Definitely feels like there's something ""missing"" in certain places, for example during combat the animations between the ""normal units"" are kind of dull, like the units just kind of blend together and look like they're barely smacking the air in front of each other, it just lacks character especially in comparison to Shogun 2. I don't know if this game will live up to Shogun 2 but it has a chance to with patches for right now. The first big update; 1.1.0 looks very promising(One big fix is the 200% UI scaling, I play in 1440p and was squinting the whole time my first few playthroughs.), and a few more future ones that fix balance and hopefully all the small issues sprinkled everywhere. Definitely missing the charm that Shogun 2 had in a lot of places, I don't feel like watching the battles as much, and the units don't seem to blend or interact with one another like I'm used to in Total War. Deep down I feel a little disappointed with or bored of this game sometimes, but it shows a lot of promise through patches and DLC, as the game is fairly solid and fun upon release. 

I couldn't bring myself to finish or play Empire, Napoleon(yet), and probably will never play Rome 2 or buy Attila for that matter because this empty feeling takes over at an even larger extent in these titles (primarily at release). I feel disappointed and uncharmed by the game because it simply feels rushed or unfinished. I'll probably play Empire or Napoleon down the line regardless with Darthmod or something because they're in a much better state then when they came out and my PC can handle them way better than before.

TLDR; Almost like Shogun 2, this game feels pretty complete and like it will just get better and better with patches and DLC. But it's edging on a thin line that makes me feel like it's rushed and unfinished for right now. I haven't even finished a run yet and something just feels off, or dull at times. Leaving me feeling a bit disappointed or bored at some points while I'm playing. Three Kingdoms lacks the charm and polish that made and makes me absolutely thrilled to play Shogun 2 every time ever since it came out. This could change knowing CA's track record with a game: as long as it's release isn't TOO bumpy it just grows and thrives. 
I'll have to give Warhammer 2 a spin since it's been out a while and the DLC isn't threatening my wallet as much, and much of the fanbase considers it the best modern Total War right now. Hopefully when I come back to this game I don't feel so empty or like something is missing all the time, after 1.1.0 I'll definitely finish a campaign however.

When I next update this review it will be shorter, more organized, and concise; like I normally would like to have it; as I don't like spending a lot of time writing and just want to get the message across to whoever reads it. Sometimes I just get lost in my own attention to detail and end up losing track of thought or confusing myself.

I just feel really passionate about this series so I wrote this one as pretty much a rant.

Definitely a solid game to get into the series with, but in its current state I'd say some fans may feel like there's more to be desired or a little disappointed.

Therefore, I can't speak of how poorly or well this game relates to anything prior.  I've always been a huge fan of the fantasy genre and absolutely love the Warhammer series so I figured I'd give this a shot as I'm also intrigued by the Romance series.

This game certainly does not disappoint.  It is evident the diplomacy has been revamped.  I like every aspect better than that of the aforementioned series.  There is a ""Quick Deal"" button that shows you all of the known factions and whether or not they'll accept said offer.  Saves a lot of time as opposed to going through each faction individually.  There is a lot that goes into the diplomacy as well.  Vassals, War, Trade among other topics all have their own diplomacy tab, just to give you an idea of the depth.

The gameplay is similar to that of Warhammer, and I'm assuming the rest of the franchise.  I was skeptical of there not being a wide enough variety of troops to keep me interested (Battle-wise) as I was likely spoiled with the fantasy genre of Warhammer.  There are a good number of unit variations as you progress through the skill tree with 1 or 2 ""Special"" units per Leader.  There is some variance between Leaders as well.  Each seem to have their own agenda and playstyle, which changes things up some.

The city control, settlement building, unit movement and recruitment are all basically the same to the previous title.  The only thing I had trouble initially grasping was that of the ""Satisfaction"" of each city. I got that it was basically the Public Order but was not aware of the ""Corruption"".  I was frustrated that I was capturing cities, farms, ports etc yet losing income every turn...  Increasingly so.  Finally realized and discovered how corruption is so important and was able to mediate it on my subsequent playthrough.  

With all of this being said, even with over 700hrs of gameplay on Warhammer II alone, there was still a relatively steep learning curve as I wasn't familiar with previous installments.  There were many things, including my economy (As previously stated), reasons why one faction became upset with me when all signs pointed to what should've been a positive outcome, along with certain battle instances where the AI Cavalry decimated my Spearmen.  I still have some head scratchers but ultimately I feel it's a well polished game.

I purposely waited until I gave the game a fair shake to write this review because there were and are still some things I'll have to wait to find out.  Currently I have just over 70hrs logged and I'm on my 3rd try.  My first play I chose Cao Cao.  I ultimately had alliances and friends all over the map.  There was no where and nothing to do unless I wanted to become ""Untrustworthy"" and start wars with allies.  I chose to restart as Lui Bei.  This is where the economy crippled me.  I was about 1k in the green then went to war with Ma Teng.  Conquered his territory along with what was remaining from the Han Dynasty and ended up -7K....  Minus SEVEN THOUSAND.  WTF reset.  This time I'm playing as Gongsun Zan.  Doing well but nearly to the point of my Cao Cao campaign.  Just became Emperor so I lost a few friends along the way.  I have a good economy and grip on the Northeast.  I do feel as though I've gotten a better feel for the game and its mechanics now.  I'm only saying this because I'm sure this game will be off-putting because the tutorial isn't great and there is so much involved.  Things won't come easy but when they click, they click.

One last thing I'd like to touch on, which is a great plus for this game is the espionage.  There are a ton of options along 4 chains of actions for your spy to perform.  All require faction points, which are accrued by turn and spy points which are accrued by that individual spy.  Which options are available depend on the position your spy attains while embedded in that faction.  If they lead a military force, they can perform actions that give you line of sight or even hinder or defect that force.  One pleasant surprise on my Cao Cao play through was that my spy was appointed as Sun Jian's family member.  My spy developed such close ties that Sun Jian adopted him.  At that point, once I accrued the necessary amount of points, I assassinated the heir, Sun Ce.  Spies can also defect and change sides and you might also have to face them in battle.  I had to face one in battle and they retreated early but I ensured I focused on the other two generals so I didn't kill my own.  The possibility of spies also adds a cautious side to my tactics.  I'm currently skeptical of SIma Yi's intentions.  I know he was always close with Lui Bei but suddenly he comes to me...  He asks for a higher court position, which I know would give him more accessibility in my faction but do I want to risk losing such a good general??  We'll see but I'd rather not banish his ass lol.

I miss agents (I hate the new system, and think it should of been merged into the old one or something), I miss ship battles, I miss more ammo being in the siege weapons, I miss better combat animations, and I wish I didn't have to wait for mods to fix what has been taken away. Why not add Korea and Japan or Mongols at this point? It's just kind of hollow as it is.

Do you recommend this game at full price? No. Plain and simple buy warhammer 2.

this review will get lost in the sea of 4 hours positive reviews from people with no real total war experience but hear me out for those of you tight on money and wanting to spend it properly.

While at first I enjoyed the game I very quickly realized how shallow an experience this really is. It's clear to see that it's unfinished. Not sure what that month of polishing accomplished but the AI and the amount of clear balance issues present on launch are staggering. Many legendary lords have gold names at level 1 but no model/portrait and some even have mode/unique gear but no legendary traits/gold color. It's very confusing and is clearly a sign the game was released unfinished to get money. Day 1 DLC? Said DLC being the only faction that's even remotely diverse in the game since every other faction is basically a copy paste. 

Let's break it down like this

[b]AI:[/b] worst AI I've seen in total war in awhile. Quite easy to cheese and quite hard to lose to even on legendary. Once you get a decent stack I found it difficult to ever lose to the AI even with all it's stat padding from difficulty. I can even link videos of me winning battles where I was pitched against around 8-10k troops with a mere 2k and completely decimating the AI. The biggest reason this is a big deal is because of the samey feel of all the factions. Everyone is using the same units so how is the AI losing such pitched battles using the same exact units as me with stat buffs? You really only feel threatened at the very start of the game and after that you basically steam roll the game. AI will literally let you shoot them with artillery and archers for free 90% of the time and despite a patch to address ""cav will no longer charged into braced spears"" they do it quite often. My biggest complaint is how the AI can't organize itself at all and despite having a numbers advantage will chase your cav around like it's a fucking cat in heat and instead of pressing it's advantages in numbers will chase your cav around the map giving you free art/archer volleys. You also can't take advantage of any ambush/forest mechanics in this game since CA thought it be a good idea to give the AI no Fog of war on the campaign map/battle map meaning they will always just zoom at your hidden units.

[b]Units-[/b] This is by far the most disappointing thing in the game and I'm not crying that there is no real diversity in unit rosters because realistically there is but the problem is the way CA priced units recruitment/upkeep is just plain retarded. It's like they didn't play test anything or atleast have  competent people playtest the game because it makes no sense how for example let's just say X faction has unique spear units. The main difference being mostly a slight stat buff between the two. What CA decided would be smart is make the unique spear units twice the cost/upkeep as it's only SLIGHTLY worse counterparts making said unique units pointless to recruit. This is the downside of not having unit recruitment tied to buildings anymore which honestly was a bad decision. They basically didn't know how to properly balance recruiting so they just jacked up the prices on higher tier units essentially alienating them and making them pointless. Most unique units really have no reason to take over their dopplegangers because they cost way more and have mild stat boosts that are in general pointless once units reach rank 10 veterancy. You basically never have a need to field the end game units 1. because they are mostly bad 2. they cost wayy to much. 3. Veterancy literally caps stats and makes almost all the units regardless if peasant or not literally the same.

That all being said Unit balance is terrible. Game is dominated by Archers/Artillery/Cav and melee are pointless. I laugh at all the ""assault"" type melee infantry who you would think would get lot of kills when flanking people but in fact get like 10 kills in a prolonged fight vs archers who can score over 200+ kills a battle even a rank 1 and even against armored targets that they aren't suppose to be good against. Not sure why the archers in this game fire like machine guns but they do. Cav are quite literally unstoppable. You can actually run full vanguard armies with nothing but Cav and shit stomp every stack in the game quite easily. Spears having to be ""locked in place"" to counter Cav is a joke and easy to get around. The funniest part about it is even heavy armored spear units lose to militia cav in a straight up fight if they don't get a charge deflection seriously who tested this game?

[b]Campaign-[/b] While difficult at first because of all the new mechanics added they are quite easy to work around and once you figure out how everything works it's hard not to snowball by turn 60-70 and just steamroll the map. I really enjoy the diplomacy upgrade they did but it's also really easy to abuse and get massive income/territory from taking advantage of the AI's stupidity. Also let's talk about vassals. Holy fuck how can my vassals be dragging me into wars? They shouldn't have any say in anything especially if I'm not giving them autonomy. Not to mention the AI tends to vassal EVERYONE IN FUCKING SITE whenever they can. I'm not just talking about Yuan shao either his mechanic is vassals so that's fine but in the late game anytime you're trying to clean up a smaller faction right before they get finished off they run off to a bigger faction and get vassaled making you unable to finish them off. They then immediately re declare war on you with help now. This makes the campaign a fucking slog to be honest. I have 5-6 unfinished late game campaigns I just can't be bothered to finish because it got so grindy and boring to finish. I've said it on stream multiple times that this game is quite simply NOT fun at all in the late game. It's not even difficult either it's just annoying. CA successfully made the most annoying total war end game outside of attila's.


honestly there's lot more I wanna say but I can't be bothered because I'm pretty much over the game at this point. I should of known seeing day 1 DLC that this was gonna be a cash grab similar to thrones. This game is clearly just a way for them to easily farm the Asian market a market CA has never been able to get into before. I really wanted a new historical game but honestly don't think CA did. They are still so stuck on warhammer that they even introduced Warhammer style gameplay to their historical game with generals who can 1v1000 literally. I personally dislike romance mode and think it's very unbalanced and ruins the game but that being said there is no alternative because records feels untouched and literally exactly the same just with a generals bodyguard. I guess the success of this game just helps fuel more polish content for warhammer 3 so should be happy about that but I certainly can't recommend this unfinished game to people for 60 dollars. It makes sense why majority of the totalwar community youtubers/content creators have already stopped playing this a week later and why CA pushed so hard for initial pre order sales with a massive PR campaign.",1560541030,1560736345,False,0.7531615495681763,True,False,False,1318,en

Please continuing developing and supporting this game!

TW:TK is a grand strategy game with a strong RTS element. The game has a huge diplomacy and succession system, upgrade systems to your society and cities that manage resources, spying and subterfuge, and courtly management. All to unite China. 

The GOOD: 
- All of these systems do something towards the goal of unifying China either through direct rule or through vassalage. 
- The game's combat system is really good. It flows very well compared to older games. It doesn't feel clunky at all.
- Easily an addicting Grand Strategy Game.
- The art style is very nice.
- I love the idea of the succession and marriage systems. Please emphasize these in future updates and games.

The MEH: 

- Spying seems a bit ineffective and underdeveloped. Among other things, it would be nice to somehow have a way to improve your relationship with your spy, given an appropriate cost.
- It would be nice to somehow have a graceful exit option to previous agreements with other characters. This should apply to all factions.
- The Reform Tree is quite nice, but could use some improvement or extension to cover functions the game should have.
- Unless I have missed it, I cannot see the lineage of any given character. In a game involving succession and grudges, one would think you could see who comes from who, as this is a prominent concern when dealing with others.

The UGLY: 

- The ugliness. Does not perform well on my system for the resulting quality of graphics. Needs optimization.
- Yellow Turban DLC release shortly after game release. For Shame!
- There are three factions in the game which are special and do not behave on the same level as all the others. They are hopeless factions that do not engage in the game in the ways they could. This should be fixed as part of the core game.
- There should be a random assignment game mode, as well as more game modes in general. They have (nearly) all the elements of the game prepared to create other game modes, and should do so. 


Overall, this is an 8/10. If the game were to introduce new modes and changes up to a year from now, I'd easily score it higher.",1560533181,1560533181,True,0.0,True,False,False,397,en

作者：诸葛亮 (魏晋)

朗诵：王洛勇

臣亮言：先帝创业未半而中道崩殂，

Permit me to observe: the late emperor was taken from us before he could finish his life`s work, the restoration of Han.

今天下三分，益州疲弊，此诚危急存亡之秋也。

Today, the empire is still divided in three, and our very survival is threatened.

然侍卫之臣不懈于内，忠志之士忘身于外者，

Yet still the officials at court and the soldiers throughout the realm remain loyal to you, your majesty.

盖追先帝之殊遇，欲报之于陛下也。

Because they remember the late emperor, all of them, and they wish to repay his kindness in service to you.

诚宜开张圣听，以光先帝遗德，恢弘志士之气，

This is the moment to extend your divine influence, to honour the memory of the late Emperor and strengthen the morale of your officers.

不宜妄自菲薄，引喻失义，以塞忠谏之路也。

It is not time to listen to bad advice, or close your ears to the suggestions of loyal men.

宫中府中，俱为一体，陟罚臧否，不宜异同。

The court and the administration are as one. Both must be judged by one standard.

若有作奸犯科及为忠善者，宜付有司论其刑赏，

Those who are loyal and good must get what they deserve, but so must the evil-doers who break the law.

以昭陛下平明之理，不宜偏私，使内外异法也。

This will demonstrate the justice of your rule. There cannot be one law for the court and another for the administration.

侍中、侍郎郭攸之、费祎、董允等，此皆良实，志虑忠纯，是以先帝简拔以遗陛下。愚以为宫中之事，事无大小，悉以咨之，然后施行，必得裨补阙漏，有所广益。

Counselors and attendants like Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, and Dong Yun are all reliable men, loyal of purpose and pure in motive. The late Emperor selected them for office so that they would serve you after his death.These are the men who should be consulted on all palace affairs.

将军向宠，性行淑均，晓畅军事，试用之于昔日，先帝称之曰能，是以众议举宠为督。愚以为营中之事，悉以咨之，必能使行阵和睦，优劣得所。

Xiang Chong has proved himself a fine general in battle, and the late Emperor believed in him. That is why the assembly has recommended him for overall command. It will keep the troops happy if he is consulted on all military matters.

亲贤臣，远小人，此先汉所以兴隆也；

The emperors of the Western Han chose their courtiers wisely, and their dynasty flourished.

亲小人，远贤臣，此后汉所以倾颓也。

The emperors of the Eastern Han chose poorly, and they doomed the empire to ruin.

先帝在时，每与臣论此事，未尝不叹息痛恨于桓、灵也。

Whenever the late Emperor discussed this problem with me, he lamented the failings of Emperors Huan and Ling.

侍中、尚书、长史、参军，此悉贞良死节之臣，愿陛下亲之信之，则汉室之隆，可计日而待也。

Advisors like Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, Chen Zhen, Zhang Yi, and Jiang Wan – these are all men of great integrity and devotion. I encourage you to trust them, your majesty, if the house of Han is to rise again.

臣本布衣，躬耕于南阳，苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯。

I begin as a common man, farming in my fields in Nanyang, doing what I could to survive in an age of chaos. I never had any interest in making a name for myself as a noble.

先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顾臣于草庐之中，咨臣以当世之事，

The late Emperor was not ashamed to visit my cottage and seek my advice.

由是感激，遂许先帝以驱驰。

Grateful for his regard, I responded to his appeal and threw myself into his service.

后值倾覆，受任于败军之际，奉命于危难之间，尔来二十有一年矣。先帝知臣谨慎，故临崩寄臣以大事也。

Now twenty-one years has passed, the late Emperor always appreciated my caution and, in his final days, entrusted me with his cause.

受命以来，夙夜忧叹，恐付托不效，以伤先帝之明，

Since that moment, I have been tormented day and night by the fear that I might let him down.

故五月渡泸，深入不毛。

That is why I crossed the Lu river at the height of summer, and entered the wastelands beyond.

今南方已定，甲兵已足，

Now the south has been subdued, and our forces are fully armed.

当奖率三军，北定中原，庶竭驽钝，攘除奸凶，兴复汉室，还于旧都。

I should lead our soldiers to conquer the northern heartland and attempt to remove the hateful traitors, restore the house of Han, and return it to the former capital.

此臣所以报先帝而忠陛下之职分也。

This the way I mean to honor my debt to the late Emperor and fulfill my duty to you.

至于斟酌损益，进尽忠言，则攸之、祎、允之任也。

Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, and Dong Yun are the ones who should be making policy decisions and recommendations.

愿陛下托臣以讨贼兴复之效，

My only desire is to be permitted to drive out the traitors and restore the Han.

不效，则治臣之罪，以告先帝之灵。

If I should let you down, punish my offense and report it to the spirit of the late Emperor.

若无兴德之言，则责攸之、祎、允等之慢，以彰其咎；

If those three advisors should fail in their duties, then they should be punished for their negligence.

陛下亦宜自谋，以咨诹善道，察纳雅言，深追先帝遗诏，

Your Majesty, consider your course of action carefully. Seek out good advice, and never forget the late Emperor.

臣不胜受恩感激。今当远离，

I depart now on a long expedition, and I will be forever grateful if you heed my advice.

1.重影问题，每次我以战斗模式仰望天空，都有重影。我不知道是什么问题。
2.画面特效问题，血袋的缺乏，以及缺少燃烧弹的画面效果。
3.突然发生的事件太单一，决策选项缺少玩家权衡各方面后果的机制。除特定事件以外，大多数事件，都是一位大臣和另一位大臣观点对立，所导致的冲突事件，让我来进行抉择。无论选择哪一方的决定，都是相同的，对另一个人没有任何效果。这样导致了游戏不仅突发事件很单一，而且游戏没有给予玩家自己做决定平衡各方面后果的选项。
4.给予人物年轻衰老的模样。整个战全战三国的重点在个人的各个方面都是非常巧妙的。例如，个人装备、个人特点、单挑等功能，都可以证明全战三国在游戏中的重心是向个人倾斜，而在游戏开发的时候，所设定的喜怒哀乐的特效模样，是非常精巧的。但如果设定人物的年轻衰老的模样，不就更增添了人物的人性化和玩家对游戏的趣味了吗？
5.关于子嗣问题问题，有两大类。其中一个是大臣。只能有政治婚姻，而不能与民间结婚，导致一些大臣终身无嗣。第二类君主，虽然能与民间结婚，但配偶的年龄过大，导致君王子嗣稀薄。
6.食物问题，在玩这个游戏的过程中，我觉得如果缺少了食物，首先，公共秩序是极低的，但是军队还是不缺食物。我认为它应该借鉴以前大不列颠全面战争的观点，重视供给。难道没有一句谚语说兵马未到，粮草先行，显然粮草是第一位的吗？粮草不仅是人民的根基，也是军队的命脉。应该在游戏中加入一些由于极度食物短缺而导致的军队减员和人口锐减的的事件。
7.起义军问题，在公共秩序普遍极低的地方，就会发生起义。这些起义一般只是黄巾军的起义。感觉太单调了。可以发展其他非黄巾的起义军。例如，在王莽代汉以后，有绿林军和赤眉军。应该有一些创新。另外，一般起义都是称为黄巾乱军，我想问一下，乱军是怎么能起义成功呢？没有一定的战略目标，没有筹集兵马器械的物资的能力，没有领导者的深谋远略，足智多谋的才能，没有将士的浴血奋战的志向，这一切都是不可能的。因此，它不能被称为乱军，而是在起义之后，它应该与其他派别的领导人进行外交，并在外交的谈判桌上换取利益的筹码。
这是我的反馈，我希望开发商会采纳我的建议。并在此希望全战三国这个游戏将变得越来越出色，越来越精彩。",1560445882,1560751269,True,0.52173912525177,True,False,False,9,zh-cn

great game very enjoyable and the romance mode is a nice new touch to the classic TW games, maybe get a unit that can counter generals tho so that you cant win by just KILLING THOUSANDS WITH THE ALMIGHTY FLYING GENERAL! THE TRUE GOD OF WAR
(i love seeing Lü bu slaughter all those that oppose him but if there was at least 1 unit that could that would be great)  
this way having to defend a town without generals would be easier 
( now i just lure them out to get shot by the towers untill death comes upon them)
 also i found this cheesy way to easily make the fight fair when outnumbered by just letting the whole army follow 1 unit all over the map to exhaust them, very time consuming but if its an important battle very much worth it.
maybe change the upkeep of units and generals tho? having every piece of land north of the yellow river, and only  being able to supplement 1 full, 2 halve armies and 1 retinue of LÜ bu and friends for almost everything that i earn while every1 around me declares war on my poor faction

looking forward to more DLCs to improve the game experience on historical stories, e.g. more real historical generals and factions, more special historical events.

there are also some aspects which can be modified to make the game follow the history line better, for example,
1. locking the visiting generals to the regions where they should be according to the history;
2. add more special characteristics to specified generals, like Guan Yu and Zhang Fei's absolute loyalty to Liu Bei rather than an incredible ez surrender after getting captured;
3. the marriage setting is so ridiculous, how could it be possible that a heir general like Sun Ce would join other faction provided that the faction pay some money or food to his father;
4. the military access setting is totally unfriendly to the player faction as those AI armies can move in your territories arbitrarily even without any diplomatic punishment.

Anyway, it's reeeally a very good game on the historical simulation of 3K.
100 percent recommended.

Haven't played anything seriously in years. Last Total War game that I have played and really enjoyed was Napoleon. Tried the other ones that were released in the meantime but they just weren't doing it for me.

However, Total War Three Kingdoms is really something completely different. It threw me right back into childhood and the ages of Rome TW. I believe they have nailed almost everything in this game. I really like and recommend one of the most exiting history periods. I have to give my respects to whoever decided to go down the romance mod/records mod divide. That was a brilliant way of dealing with the idealization of the events from the books. 

As to the negatives. My gosh, I simply must take a point away from them because of the first day DLC which isn't a skin/mask of a kind, but rather just game content itself. Game content was carved out of the base game to produce further income. That is a kind of sales policy that cannot go unnoticed and overlooked by the community. I mean, you are literally barred from playing some of the characters with some a couple of lines of code. The actual content is there. Quite shameful.

Besides that, still one of the worst things in this game is the AI. I have to give my respect since CA tried to make this a bit better and actually managed to do so. Sometimes the battle AI is affected and will act slightly different based on the difficulty slider. But in the end, what the difficulty sliders are doing is just buff/debuffs to stats. The AI itself won't change all that much. On higher difficulties there is no way for the player not to feel really cheated by the AI.

Final Score: 8/10 / Would recommend.

However I must admit, while the game is rough around the edges on every front. God, this is the single most beautiful Grand Strategy anything I've ever touched. 

If I had to describe this game, it is Shogun 2 with a fresh coat of paint, however while Shogun 2 bored me with its almost too balanced gameplay and boring campaign, Three Kingdoms gave me an experience that while is indicative of being a freshly launched title. It is interesting, fun and consistently both throughout the course of the entire Campaign and that is something that Total War has never been able to do in the entirety of its existence.

Both Battle and Campaign are wonderful experiences, keep in mind that balancing and AI logic are still very early launch feeling, and I cannot complement enough that despite the AI being your classical Total War AI, that for the first time, I actually feel mildly challenged in Battles. Add it in with the fact that the Campaign is genuinely challenging as well, AI is the perfect balance of different archetypes between: Bloodthirsty (Cao Cao or Dong Zhuo) to Self-Serving (Yuan Shao or Yuan Shu) or Trustworthy Friend (Liu Bei or Sun Jian) which keeps the dynamic of the map and the formation of Great Powers actually important outside of just simply just thinking about your neighbors in matter of solely strength and size.

Now all of my hours have been in Romance Mode, and I must say, its handling of Heroes is wonderful, if not unbalanced. While I love that they have a huge impact on both battles and Campaigns, I feel like they have almost too much influence in the two gameplay sections. Heroes are absolute powerhouses in battles, at the end of certain battles, I would just lose due to not having heroes on the field, despite having much of my army intact, they would just get town apart by a group of Heroes. Meanwhile on the Campaign side, their traits will sway your economic, court and domestic affairs, a lot, maybe even more than new players would realize at first. But I suppose that's the appeal to nurturing your Heroes for much of the campaign.

Finally, I would like to list off some Pros and Cons, and cut the Review Shorter than the essay I had in mind initially.

Pros:
+ Graphically Breathtaking and Stylized Wonderfully
+ Enduring Fun
+ No Bullcrap Endgame Realm Divide/Realm Decay (Except for Corruption)
+ Refreshing Romance Mode Gameplay
+ Isn't a Warhammer Title /s
+ Refines Much of the Total War Gameplay
+ Fixes Many Mistakes that Britannia, Attila, Rome 2 and Shogun 2 Made
+ Amazing Chinese Voiceovers
+ Actually Worthwhile Yellow Yurban DLC(Maybe Update When More Come Out)

Cons:
- No Blood (Yet?)
- Unbalanced
- Heroes Too Strong
- Questionable AI Sometimes
- That English Voiceover
- I Ran Out of Reasons

Rather than add to an unending chorus of praise, I will respond to the biggest criticism of this game regarding unit diversity. Id say its about as diverse as Shogun 2 in all honesty. The battles are for tactics while the campaign map is for strategy. Adding slight variations of spears, bows, swords, etc will not help with tactics. It will only add to the amount of  minutia to memorize. Each unit type has a tactical use, and you can progressively upgrade each unit type. Why complain? This is basically the exact same as Shogun 2. My only gripe is that there is no gunpowder but it has to be historically accurate. 

As for diverse factions, that's definitely the case here. Every faction has a unique trait that informs their playstyle. Not to mention the many historical characters that all have their own personality - which is reflected in their strategic strengths. Its extremely satisfying to develop these characters through alternative histories and see them clash. It also means that each campaign feels quite different from the previous one, where in previous total war games they can all be quite samey. 

Total War three kingdoms is fantastic, but I dont think it can dethrone the masterpiece that is Shogun 2. I really appreciate CA's direction to not include faction pack DLC or other obvious scams. If they make an expansion pack for this game which expands the historical narrative, thereby allowing even more units and strategy that would be great. Also, the fact that they included records mode is fantastic. I know I would not have bought the game without it.

Massively improved diplomacy, economy, spying options, and supply system that all works perfectly for a Three Kingdoms game. Characters with their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and background uses (though things will start to overlap as you see many characters with similar backgrounds or passive skills from their class tree). Starting factions, resource locations, and gameplay elements unique to each lord can drastically change how you want to build your force/economy. Has more realistic records mode or powered up character romance mode that makes generals similar to heroes in Warhammer. Seasonal changes effect economy, food, and battles.

Not a wide variety of units to use with many going to be locked behind reforms that you won't reach or behind starting lord choices. The one artillery piece seems extremely powerful, even ignoring its uses for siege and settlement battles, I tended to finish fights with each one getting between 3-6 hundred kills, wiping out around 3-5 units alone before even getting into all the unit routing they cause. I never really lost a fight even when outnumbered by quite a bit once I threw two of them into every army I had (I suppose I could have used six), and would assume they would be even more powerful in records mode. Maybe more balanced on a higher difficulty. The actual battles are fun but aren't near as interesting as the Warhammer games, helped both by unit variety and the content they have gotten over the years. You can't really watch the character duels that well in romance mode since you need to command the actual battle going on while characters fight and the game really likes to make your characters lose duels for no reason when you choose to auto resolve small fights. Some of the pre and in battle dialogue is terrible and not at all matching with certain characters. Odd to see certain characters not being legendary (though some that should be still start with better equipment or a unique description), maybe more of a balance reason with more likely being added later.

I think that the game does a great job at holding your attention for the most part. Theyve fixed a lot of key issues, one of which is that the city troops can actually defend against smaller forces. This means that you dont really have to worry about the Han empire all that much after you get yourself established. Also heroes bring a lot into the game as well, They can take down whole units on there own. But if you get to reckless with the heroes they will be cut down rather quickly. The game also has a good balance of micro managing in the battles. You can easily through a line of infantry at the enemy, as long as you have a general behind the line you can go and manage your cav and archers.
     One of the main problems is the lack of any real artillery. You only have a single option for artillery.

You  make warfare, then you make peace (for a price) especially if the tide of war turns against you or the other nation.  One moment your good with little or no one warring on you, then boom you have many other kingdoms warring on you, and you will need to work the politics sue for peace and scale things down.  Another thing, i like that the game does not just war on you just for the sake of warring.  If you have territories that are not coveted, or your army is not considered an a threat O.O, the game actually will leave you be, well to some extent.  So even a little no one like a Bandit ""Queen"" has a chance if you build and are patient and bide your time.

You really have to pay attention to your general, if you pick poorly you may have to do a lot of micro managing to keep them loyal, if you pick well, then not quite as much.  Its nice that we can give our General rewards that grant boons to their stats  and loyalty.  The game has a lot to do, and feels immersive, it feels like they did the period history justice.  The game is not not perfect, but its very well done.   

I also like that the game thinks I am sucking and keeps suggesting that i lower the difficulty level during my campaign O.o!?  So little faith in me :(, LoL.  Regardless I keep inching and increasing my territories, and overall strength.  Challenge is what I want, no way will i reduce the difficulty, but its appreciated :)!

They need to take some of this love for Three Kingdoms, and fix Thrones of Britannia...sigh, i really wanted to love that game.  In no time I found myself owning half the map (TOB), and i usually pick the weakest factions.

I could go on and on that this Three Kingdoms is a good purchase, but I am sure others will cover what I have not, hope this review helps.

I got the Yellow Turban DLC free when I preordered. It is absolutely necessary for the campaign at least so if you refuse to pay extra for what should be in the game I can't blame you but your game will feel different.

No naval battles (despite China's rich naval history) but I assume it will be added.

-Great focus on characters. Extensive skilltrees, opinions, rivalries, marriages, kids, etc. CKII of Total War :)
-Diplomacy that actually works and makes sense, First time in TW history (not counting mods)
-Great optimisation - no crashes and gamebreaking bugs since day 1, also  - modest AI turn times (until very-very lategame)
-Big map and lots of factions allow generally longer campaigns than in other TW games

So-so:

-Battles are just Atilla:Total War with added character-heroes. If you liked combat in Atilla, you will like this. If you prefer other TW's combat, you might be disappointed a bit

Cons:

-No Workshop (yet)
-Story component is weaker than it should be. Each faction have only 1 short ark and it will pass in like 5% of the game. For rest of the campagn - only random events, which are rare and dont make sense sometimes (family relocation being perfect example)
-Trailer music is great, battle music is ok, but strategic map music...of all classic Chinese motives they somehow picked the WORST. Its really annoying. For the first time I turned off music in TW game after first few hours
-Map is big, but contains some VERY questionable gamedesign decisions. I mean it was in TW before, but there it is on the scale of epic proportions - like, a two towns from same commandery on DIFFERENT sides of a big impassable mountain, each having towns from OTHER commanderies nearby?! ffs, this thing kills all immersion and pretense of realism

I really like this game and the setting, however until they fix the frequent crashes to desktop this is not worth the price and I regret buying this at launch.

This type of stability issues are unforgivable.  The crashes are way to frequent, almost hourly, for this to not have been noticed.  

The supposed patch for stability made the issue worse /sigh
Have not tried the beta patch as a customer I shouldnt have to test their game or fixes.  >.<

---- EDIT ----

With the latest patch the stability issues for me have cleared up alot, still there but not as severe.  I still say that the game should not have been launched in this matter but at least this issue is being addressed.  

Now if they could fix the lack of children and some diplomacy issues like being spammed with coalition members trying to invite others that dont want to join then this game could be as good as shogun 2 imo.

Diplomacy: If the player chooses, diplomacy can be a much larger part of the campaign compared with previous total war games. 

Battle: Combat is less about Rock Paper Scissors. Archers have greater range and damage potential. Calvary like in recent total war titles are still extremely strong (although fewer in number compared with Atilla and Rome2).

Campaign: I found myself greatly attached to my generals and it is very sad when they finally die of old age at the end of the campaign. Players can choose to follow the story or decide their own path. This is an great addition to total war that provides the game with better immersion. 

Art: Armor and portrayal of characters is more fantasy rather than historical but it is nonetheless pretty impressive. The design of the campaign map and in battle scenery is gorgeous.

With some small exception in the Warhammer games, the diplomacy has always felt a little shallow, or kind of random. There was some odd kind of distance or fogginess between your faction and the others, so that diplomacy was kind of there, but not central.

That's not true in Three Kingdoms. While everyone starts the game on their own, there is a definite flow as the community of China's warlords start to make alliances, claim vassals, and even develop friendships between characters that give real depth to the other factions. There is meat in diplomacy this time, so much so that you can't even choose to ignore it.

By mid-game, everyone has chosen a side, so you don't just get to build a couple of max stacks and attack your neighbor. I mean, you CAN, but there will be consequences that you get to see as a list of modifiers to every relationship you have. I've found myself needing to grow but not having any unaffiliated factions to target, so I have to, well, scheme my way into some political opportunity, or if I'm stumped on a plan, to just wait until a move by another faction opens up an opportunity for me.

To help with this, each faction has a series of story missions that direct your planning, which you may find helpful as a guide, or you may choose to completely ignore. The guidance is awesome when you want it, but not in your face. It's very well done.

Finally, you have to spend time with your (eventually large) group of court nobles. They have career plans of their own, and the little rascals don't get along with everybody. It's enough of a ""thing"" in the game to matter, but not too tedious. If you're completely careless, you might see some pretty crazy political schemes unfold right in your own court. It's beautiful.

So far I have no complaints. Being bound by diplomacy can feel like ropes around my neck, but that adds a sense of strategy to the game that hasn't existed in such a meaningful way until Three Kingdoms. The battles, though still well done, are not center stage, anymore.

What it lacks in unit variety compared to say Medieval II Total War it more than makes up for with its diplomacy system, which is a huge improvement over previous titles. Negotiating deals and making alliances with other factions is now essential to survival, especially on the higher difficulties, and on very hard or legendary difficulty you will be opening the diplomacy panel almost every turn, whether it's to trade food and items for money, or to push a faction you want to attack out of a coalition. Many of the negative reviews complain about how the AI targets the player unfairly. While this is certainly true, I think it's a pro rather than a con as it forces you to use diplomacy to the fullest and get real creative with your campaign strategy (for example, becoming one faction's vassal, then persuading that faction to declare war on a strong faction, then when both factions are weakened from war, betraying your master). 

That being said, the game has its flaws. Some other features of this game that look good on paper add little value. Character relationships are largely pointless, as all you have to do is give promotions to keep generals happy, and any diplomatic penalties stemming from them can be overcome with money or other resources. Espionage is interesting, but totally unnecessary for beating a campaign and also frustrating to use, as it depends on whether your spy gets hired by the other faction, which is mostly random. Also, there are a lot of technologies and items that increase the cost of spy actions, so it can take a lot of turns before your spy can actually do something useful. 

Overall, I'd give it an 8.5/10.",1560201219,1560201219,True,0.0,True,False,False,299,en

The Ai in both battles and campaign is much smarter and will challenge you both fairly and unfairly, making you fear the potential of other factions and it forces you to use every tool available in the game to go forward.

Pros: 

Great Graphics while being more stable than Warhammer 2
Great Ai
Great setting and a lot of love put into the whole game's design overall.
Great Battles

Cons: 

No improvements to the multiplayer campaign
Lack of troop variety

The minor complaint is that when your archers run out of arrows, they don't automatically run into battle, they instead stand and wait for your order. It's happened to me a few times where they would run out of arrows and they would stand around for minutes before I realized.

First off here are the Pro's
- Fast paced battles
- Very fluid and unique unit animations and combat styles
- Very artistic map design, love it or hate it, in my eyes a unique map is better than generic
- Large and meaningful skill tree's and upgrade tree's
- Unique factions / leaders & Champions
- diverse Spy network system
Honestly there is a lot more i could mention here, truly the game has a wealth of pro's to take from, but a lot of those are similar to other Total War games, and in my mind is to be expected from all Total War titles.
Now on to the Con's
- A confusing and awkward user interface (unit cards, upgrade tree, and diplomacy tab are the worst offenders)
- A lot of troops feel quite samey/ similar to other units
- Generals / Vanguards / Champions feel a little bit too strong in Romance mode, being able to decimate entire units by themselves
- Early game cavalry feels underwhelming and very expensive, not quite the unit crushing charges of Rome 2 / Thrones of Britania

All in all Total War: Three Kingdoms is a wonderful breath of fresh air for the Total War formula, and i hope to see an iteration of Romance mode in future Total War titles, nothing seems cooler to me than having Leonidas leading his spartan army into battle. but overall or any historic era this would be a welcome mode.

To conclude, if a clunky and sometimes tricky UI is a deal breaker for you then this Total war game maybe a miss. 
Overall i think this is worth the full retail price and as community mods roll in the game is only going to get better and better.
If the Con's seem to outweigh the Pro's for you, maybe wait until the game goes on sale later down the line?",1560014028,1560014028,True,0.0,True,False,False,354,en

[b]A bit longer: [/b]Looks great. Great music. Challenging from normal difficulty onward. Lot of in game rewards and tactical choices. Profound Rock-Paper-Scissors battles. A solid 8/10,

[b]Elaborate:[/b]

I am a veteran Total War player with more than 4000 hours on all titles combined. Yes I am a fan, so I am biased, but still am critical. Since Shogun 2 I usually play on very hard and occasional legendary. This one I finished like 6 times ranging from normal to very hard (with hard battle settings).

[b]Pro's:[/b]

- Music
- Looks
- Stability
- Scale
- Atmosphere

- Challenge (some people complain that the AI gets huge unfair advantages (increasing with difficulty): this is true. But in my opinion this brings ongoing challenge, so the great downfall of the Rome II title where you just steamrolled all minor nations gets avoided. The game provides challenging enemies till the end, much like the Warhammer titles).

- On normal difficulty and below the usual *end game grind* to victory is shortened by some sort of surrender. Which avoids the drag of previous games where you have won in all respects, but just have to carry it through.

- A lot of in game choices and rewards, and multiple layers of gameplay like: Strategic movement, economy building, diplomacy, trade, espionage, character management etc.

[b]Neither Pro Nor Con:[/b]

- As in most TW titles the tactical battlefield AI isn't great, but I am used to it by now, and admiddetly I couldn't play very hard or legendary if the AI with 3-1 ratio was really smart. The AI even seems a little dumber than in Warhammer, for example cavalry ignores your unprotected ranged units.

- Diplomacy has much more options that in previous titles, but knowing who is who, who is friends with who, where who is located, is rather unclear. In the beginning I had real trouble with all the Chinese names and factions, having no clue as to where Suhsi Wong was, who Dong Kong might be, and if Fu Yong Hai was my neigbour or not.

- Browsing characters to assign gear should have browse arrows, so you can cycle through them.

[b]Con's:[/b]

- Mainly because the two Warhammer titles offered so much diversity in units, generals, landscape, buildings, races, this title seems a bit bland compared to that. Ranged kill everything not in melee, melee tanks other melee, cavalry tries to get to ranged. Most units differ very marginally in stats, and the elite units you can research seem rather underwhelming (except for two or three). It is back to Shogun in unit variety, and then Shogun 2 seemed to do the rock-paper-scissors part better.

- Unless CA comes up with great DLC, I think I will be done with this after I got my achievements, and played every faction. Hundreds of hours, not the 1400 I have in Warhammer 2. A good game, but with limited freshness guarantee. But then again, I said that of Warhammer 1 also, not knowing what Mortal Realms would bring to that game.

8/10, from a Total War addict.

Then there are the battle simulators. You could spend endless hours fighting one battle with numerous strategic view points. Outnumbered? Use the forests to conceal your archers. Use flanking elements, spear head formations and several defensive tactics. 

There isn't ""one"" way to do things in this game. It's quite incredible, the relationship system is amazing to. Build strong bonds with another captain or general of a retinue of the same unit, or become enemies. All goes the same for all other factions to. Just love this game so far.

Nerd cred out of the way, let's talk 3 Kingdoms.

The Good: I really like the character system and their representation of these larger than life characters. As such, I play in Romance mode. Managing your generals, their traits, and how they interact is a large part of the game. You can even be friends with future enemies. My first Sun Jian campaign had Liu Bei as his ally basically forever. We wrecked Cao Cao and Yuan Shao together so we were friends when the 3 Kingdoms Period came about.

The diplomacy system is actually transparent and functional with a much broader variety of what you can do than in most games. Some of this is locked behind faction prestige ranking, but that's usually not a problem as you want to expand anyway. Gone are the days when everyone hates you for no reason. You can even stay on relatively friendly terms with other declared emperors for a while, as was the case in my Sun Jian campaign. Small countries also don't usually declare war on you with zero ability to back it up. Usually you're already fighting a war on a couple fronts and they'll declare to steal away a few provinces before you can react.

The battle UI is pretty simple for me to understand, so if you're looking for a first time look, you need someone who hasn't played like most of the games in this series. What is a little harder to understand is the unit stats, as there are more of them and the symbols aren't as clear as just plain old words. It just takes a little learning.

The rock/paper/scissors gameplay is intuitive. Archers are very powerful, but fortunately very weak to cavalry. Cavalry is very powerful, but has a hard counter in spears and trebuchets. Infantry handily trumps spears and can withstand arrows much better, but are vulnerable to cavalry. Cavalry might be slightly broken at the moment. Usually one good charge into the back of all but the heaviest infantry sends them running, but then I guess don't let cavalry get behind you. Early game light cavalry against light infantry is the most devastating thing in the game.

Proper sieges are back and even small settlements are interesting to fight through provided they have their own maps. The only ones I've seen that don't are livestock and regular farms and even then there are some buildings you can use to protect your flanks.

The Bad: The battle AI is as dumb as ever. The only reason I have won several battles is because the AI will just charge cavalry right into a prepared unit of spear infantry. Like, even if the cavalry isn't being useful in attacking, it could just tie up a few units by standing there looking threatening instead of killing itself and letting me run my spears to flank once their primary job is done.

The march stance is frustrating to deal with on the campaign map, especially because hostile troops negatively impact public order in the province. Their ability to just march out of reach and then when you can attack them, they retreat out of range for a follow up is frustrating and needs to be changed. If you make the mistake of marching into enemy territory using the march stance, then that's your fault and you should be punished for that by not being allowed to retreat when engaged.

The unit roster is not very diverse, but that's to be expected for the location and era. I understand why they did it, but there's a reason why I loved Medieval II and the Warhammer games. All the factions felt massively different and you had to use their units in very different ways. But this is a nod to the time period, so it has to be that way, similar to how Shogun II was.

Character abilities can be somewhat underwhelming. They are either too strong or too weak and some have too small of an area of effect to really be useful. That's something of a nitpick.

The corruption mechanic on the campaign map was mildly frustrating to deal with until I discovered the judicial building chain with the cap lowering corruption in both the local and adjacent commanderies.

Now, admittedly, the game does have some good stuff going for it, even by Historical title standards;
-a more translucent diplomacy AI, you can see quite obviously how everyone will react and what is required for diplomacy.
-Food supplies have been updated since Thrones of Brittania and can now be traded in diplomatic agreements.
-A supply system indicates how long your armies can operate outside of your regions
-Expanded diplomatic options, I particularly like the Coalitions as you get groups of factions allied.
-And my favorite, siege battles follow in the form of Thrones in that they are actually effective to get around and fun to play.

However, it definitely pales in comparison to other aspects of the Historical titles, such as Rome II and Shogun II;
-As mentioned, battles play similarly to Warhammer - though the battle maps are larger than the aforementioned and sieges are fleshed out.
-Despite enhanced understanding of AI in diplomacy it is still just as likely to turn on you 180 degrees if you're not fighting someone.
-You need to have a border with other factions to form a trade agreement, but that border has to connect to your capitol, the game doesn't tell you this, but if you advance past your borders and leapfrog an ally for a non-continuous border you can't negotiate with the people beyond that unless that territory happened to be a port.
-you can't bring military supplies to your armies besieging a city, which doesn't make sense, why can't I resupply the besieging army with an army fully supplied?
-Internal politics are inferior to that of Rome II and Attila in that there are no opposing political parties, throughout most of the game you are limited in terms of the number of government positions and yet will continue to get disloyal characters demanding a nonexistent seat in the government.
-Character relations, though an interesting idea, are poorly implemented. My wife - who I start off married to as Gongsun Zan - may be put in charge as a general in the same army and yet she despises her husband from the get go. Similarly, you can start off on positive relations, but two characters can develop differing personalities and now two generals who have been fighting side by side for ages hate each other.
-And finally, records mode, thee historical non-Romanticized play version is just as bad as Romance in terms of General strength if not more so and clearly wasn't given the same kind of love and attention that they put into Romance.

Honestly if you're interested in Historical total war titles that actually require some strategy to play get Rome II or Shogun II if you haven't already. I may not have a lot of hours in the game and it's not going to rise quickly, but the game just isn't inspiring or interesting enough to warrant playing continuously the way I can past titles.",1559856068,1559856068,False,0.5530243515968323,True,False,False,534,en

The campaign AI is smarter than its ever been, making really good use of the added depth in the diplomacy menu.

There are a few issues i have with the game but i am hoping it gets sorted over time. 1 spying needs to be improved you unlock spys quite late in the games by that point its not really worth bothering with takes ages to get them in a enemy force and then tend to end up getting killed by an attacking army or yourself if you dont realise there fighting them as your own spy will fight you to the death would of been a lot cooler if they could switch sides during a battle and flank the enemy. 2 your economy you barley make any money in this game without trade thats fine at the start were everyone doesnt hate your guts but by the end you have no trade and no money at one point i had over 80 citys and towns and couldnt afford to maintain 17 armys was losing 3000 a turn had to attack every turn to make money. 3  The emperor i made a big thing of rushing to steal him in my first campaign never bothered since if you have him you get a small bit of extra money a bit more prestige i think and the han as a vassal sounds good well its not first off why because the han are useless they will get you dragged into war after war dont help in any real way and you take there lands but cost you about 5000 to do so its cheaper to attack them. 4 and another thing with vassals i had a issue were i would make peace with someone they would then declare war on my vassal forcing me to either fight them and break are treaty or lose my vassal and break that treaty instead by the end everyone hated me. 5 last my god sort out forced march should be done like in warhammer if your attacked in force march you should have to fight but in three kingdoms they just retreat into your lands and you waste turns chasing them but you cant reach them when there in force march so you either ignore them and hope they find a small farm in your lands they can take to replenish or hope you get lucky and catch them. all that said amazing game go buy it then get everyone you know to but it as well hope this was helpful.,1559806338,1559806338,True,0.0,True,False,False,475,en

The game mechanic is interesting and diverse, the concept of adapting your playstyle and strategy to different warlords and hero types is very creative and engaging, but the one thing that needs a lot of improvement is the diplomacy system.
My recent playthroughs with liubei has been such a disaster: because i try to engage more into the game story i try to act like liubei in the novel, so i treat my every neighbor with kindness and respect and never declare war on any faction to raid their land(except i always declare war on caocao to save taoqian). The problem is, every ""friendly"" neighbor(especially kong rong) will backstab me whenever it seems beneficial to them and they don't give single f**k about our relation and peace treaty. I thought every one is acting like a cold son of a b*tch because its lengendary difficulty so i change it to hard, but that didnt change anything, while i was fighting the puppet master yuanshao, all the other small faction(including these which are not yuan shao's vassal) declared war on me and try to put up a guerrilla warface. I just gave up the playthrough and hand my emperorship to sunjian when i finally crushed  yuanshao's force but liubiao, the bastard who will never hand me his territory even though its in the story mission, declared war on me and stabbed me in the behind. 
Another ridiculous mechanic in this game is, if you become another faction's vassal, every other faction will become so friendly to you by no reason and you will get diplomacy income up to around 10k per turn.
Despite these problems this game is still great and i definitely give it a recommend. I just wish the developer will fix liubei's campain and diplomacy AI as soon as possible.",1559803272,1559803272,True,0.0,True,False,False,322,en

The graphics are pretty cool. Same is the China Setting. Never had a game about China. +1 for this.
But the gameplay wasted so much potential. They  introduced many new elements, but none is used for real or working properly.
Some examples:

[b]1. All armies are the same[/b]
I played with different warlords I end up with the same army setup every time. One horse, One Infantry, One Archer hero. Dot.
In detail units can be replaced by factiion specific ones, but the difference is small. The setup is the same. I dont even use archers anymore. 6 tribuchets mow down everything. What is left can be charged down by cavallery, unimportant which type, horse archers can do the job aswell. Unlike other total war games, spear units are not able anymore to protect archers or themselves from cavallery charges.

[b]2. Heroes are unimportant[/b]
It was announced to be a major point of the game, that heroes have a massive effect on the game, but I don't see it. Duels sound cool in the first place, but in the end they are just a waste of time. you can bait the enemy general out of his blob and charge him down with your cavallery. 
A duel just takes a lot of time, has a weird random factor and in the end almost no effect, as you continue the battle as normal.

[b]3. Heroes are all the same[/b]
It's not possible to make you character unique. They have a skill tree which divides in battle and campaign effects.  The funny thing about this is that only a general will be able to use the campaign effects. When you apply  a character as a minister, he cannot act as a council or missions in a region. Only a general can do this!
This means a general must skill the whole skill tree, while a campaign character doesn't need any skills at all. Maybe, one specific skill is necessary if you want to unlock a mission, but the good ones are basic unlocked.

[b]4. Heroes are boring[/b]
In development it was announced that heroes take a big effect on battles and the campaign . One dev once said ""even before battle they take influence in the night before the fight...""
Again, I don't see it. Legendary heroes are basicly killing machines and get a scripted event or two, but mostly nothing happens. Their buffs are not even very special, as +10% armor is a cool one but, not a game changer.

[b]5. Diplomancy[/b]
EA put a lot of effort on this, and thats cool. In the first moment it really feels like a corrupted bureaucratic china, but the AI is stupid an passive they cannot make a big use of it or expect anything special to happen as nothing will happen.

[b]6. Settlements are all the same[/b]
You build the same buildings everywhere. 
In a farm settlement you build all farm buildings. 
In a economy settlement you build all economy and trade buildings. 
In a trade settlement you build all economy and trade buildings.
You never build any military building as they are useless.

In the end you notice EA hat a lot of routine, making this kind of game, but they didn't have any inspiration to make it unique or high quality in some way.

its a good game.

Pros:
-better than ever (but stil exploitable) AI.
-Scripted events are a nice thing, made me remember ROT3K 13. 
-The story is well telled.
-is the best game to start in the ""three kingdoms"" lore.
-the technology tree is fine and has a good progresion.
-The GUI is very good. The best i've seen in 4k.

Cons:
-strategic economy is boring, every city almost the same.
-no military cities, armies can be mustered from everywhere and are almost the same.
-The way caracters are generated is horrible. they had like 2000 names to use, but then you encounter something like ""Jie Jaja""... why not use the original names and then have like 20% random characters?
-the rpg thing with the heroes is meh.
-armies feel small. when will be have units with 1000 soldiers? this war had battles where more than 100000 soldiers died in a day. 2000 vs 2000 feels meh. 


almost all cons can be solved with mods.

This is a time period and setting that I know is much beloved by history fans and gamers. There are games, movies, TV series, and of course novels about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but I was never familiar with this setting, save for a few plays of Dynasty Warriors at my friend's house way back in the day. As a setting for a Total War game it invites comparison to Shogun (1 and 2) - entirely taking place in one culture, in a relatively short period of time, with all factions having more or less similar unit rosters. The Three Kingdoms aspect clearly separates this title, however, because of the almost fantasy-like integration of all these 3K characters. The ""Records"" mode is standard total war - generals are mere mortals and have a bodyguard unit. The ""Romance"" mode, which is really the main point of this game, is more like a wuxia film. Generals are singular, demi-god-like figures who can engage each other in martial arts duels on the battlefield and provide their armies with all manner of buffs and bonuses. Especially in the context of a total war campaign, these characters become even more important to maintain and rank up over the course of time. There is actually some drama afoot when you send your faction leader into single combat with an enemy warlord. 

The way that armies are composed is probably the biggest change for this game. Each hero type has access to different kinds of units. For instance, Commanders can recruit advanced melee cavalry but not any infantry more sophisticated than militia. Meanwhile, Strategists can recruit all manner of missile units and artillery, but that's basically it. Each general has a mini-army of 6 units, and you can have 3 generals (and their retinues) per army stack. This means that you need to take care about which armies have what kinds of generals in them, and it creates a more dynamic style of play for you and the AI. 

The battles feel a little fast for my taste, but I get it. Overall the battles are the most similar piece of 3K to past titles. Nothing is particularly new in terms of battle gameplay, save for the general-on-general dueling. I believe the way that unit statistics are applied is different, however. Instead of a unit being composed of  however many individual men with X number of armor, hitpoints, etc., entire units now act like one statistical mass. As the unit is depleted, so are its combat power and HP stats even if half the individuals in that unit are actually unharmed. It looks more like the unit is fighting another unit, instead of 160 individuals fighting 160 individuals like in Rome 2 and Attila. I think it works. Unit blobbing / spacing is much improved, too. 

Unit diversity is pretty good considering that all factions are from the same Chinese culture (Yellow Turbans are sort of unique though, similar to the Ikko Ikki in Shogun 2). In terms of balancing I do think there is room for change. All missile units are extremely OP at this point (early June 2019) - their rate of fire and accuracy is so high, even for base level militia units, that it feels rather absurd. I also noticed only minor differences in quality between bottom and top tier Ji halberd units; especially for a unit type that requires a specialized general and lots of tech reforms to produce, the Heavy Ji unit should be a showstopper.

There are some visual things I wish I could tweak. The game looks great and runs well, but every unit carries so many (huge!) flags that it's hard to actually see what's going on when you zoom into the action. (Add to this the fact that many of the faction flags look VERY similar to my eyes.) Would be great if there were a ""flag density"" slider or something like that. The missile trails are extremely thick and ugly, but without them its genuinely hard to see any arrows - especially from defensive towers. Could there be a way to control the thickness of the missile trails? 

So there is a lot recommend here. I look forward to seeing how the game progresses over time. It's certainly the best and most stable game at launch that CA has put out in quite some time. Fans of the time period and 3K fiction will love this.

Note - I have not played either of the Warhammer games, so if there are features in 3K that were present in those game, I am ignorant to that fact.",1559777154,1559777154,True,0.0,True,False,False,791,en

Some of the mechanics need to be changed especially those that effect the mid-game point.  The game cheats you in the sense that you can see the AI factions in negative cash and also food resource yet they throw stacks after stack at you whilst suffering no attrition...this should not be a thing.

The worst tactic that the AI seems to employ is sending a stack into your territory you then have to send an army after it. Due to the 'retreat once' BS before they have to fight you, they constantly just retreat out of your reach so you can never initiate a battle. So one of your limited armies are spent chasing some minor stack of cowards around the map...get it sorted.

It connects good battles with many deep campaign mechanics that TW:Warhammer games are lacking. I'm not fan of the setting and I was very sceptical about this title, but since I bought it, it grew on me.

There are two game modes, which differ a bit. Romance mod is the main with powerful, single entity heroes with abilities that can change the tide of battles. Records mode nerf heroes a bit, they come with plenty of cavalry bodyguards, more experienced your hero is, larger bodyguards he have. Also you can equip all your heroes with weapons, armors, mounts, ancilliaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilities.

Battle AI is probably the best in the entire series. Maybe not extremely intelligent, but AI does decent job trying to use their  missile units, flank with cavalry, protect archers with infantry. Rarely I see them doing something illogical or dumb. Battle AI is much more improved from Warhammer where it was very passive so you could easily use all your ammunition to kill it. Now it moves away from the walls inside the city when you have advantage in range units, when it notices that you have no ammo left AI comes back, trying to defend the gates, blocking any breakthroughs with units, making it difficult to get inside. Even if you break the first line, usually there is second line of troops trying to block the streets. 

If AI garrison has an army inside it is much more difficult to assault. Even when attacking from few directions, they spread more units to block other ways inside. My onli gripe was that town garrisons are pretty small, smaller than minor towns garrisons, so you need to build special bulding for more units, but I think its a small issue because mods for bigger garrisons or maybe official patch should make this right.

There is plenty of units, there are militia one available for every faction and general, there are few faction units, each faction have usually 2 of them, there are special units unlocked by tech tree (reforms) which are called Dragons. There are Dragons with axes, swords, cavalry, archers each call differently. Most interesting are Azure Dragons, glaive infantry with bows. They have special formation where two first lines form up against cavalry charge and rest is sitting behind and shooting from safe. It should be mentioned that each general can recruit to 6 units and you have 5 different types of generals, higher general rank better special units he can recruit. For example strategist on level 3 can recruit medium crossbowmen and on level 6 heavy crossbowmen and sentinel can recruit special medium sword infantry. You can have maximum three generals in one army. 

Campaign is much more interesting than in other TW games. Diplomacy for the first time works. Got that guy which you wanted to trade with, but he said ""no"" everytime? Not anymore. Now you know exactly why they want peace or agreements, game shows you how much points you need to make deal done. For example if there is -5.0 when you are proposing peace it means you need to soften the deal with some cash. If you crushed them in few battles the score might be +15, that means you can order them to give you additional money or even force them into being your vassal. There is also a great option with quick deal. You click it and choose ""trade agreement"" and you see all guys who may want to trade with you. It even says ""maybe"" or ""yes"" that means you need to offer those guys that are not convinced few things in return.

Moving on there is a food mechanic which affects you in many different ways. You need food to replenish troops and make your towns growing, but if you have food surplus you might sell it to other lords for money or agreements. If you have plenty of farms, but not many high income regions you can get a lot of gold just from food distribution. Population is coming back, bigger the town is, the more people it can sustain and it gives bonuses to income and replenishment. You need to upgrade your town to get more building slots and higher population cap.

Not everything is perfect and the worst part of the game is that there are many unique lords and generals, but there is only few dozen of them. When you play and recruit more they almost always look very simillar, with same bad weapons and armor, so in the lategame when some of your heroes die of old age the game is a bit less interesting, but it helps that when you reach King rank three Kingdoms are formed, leaders became Emperors and you need the other 2 of them to abdicate or conquer their emperor seat which is in their capital. Its pretty interesting mechanic because Emperors still can make peace and trade agreements but cant ally with each other. If you have a slower start it might happen that AI trigger the event and you wont even be one of the Emperors. Then you need to capture one of the seats for you to become a pretender.

There are few bugs and maybe few mechanics that dont work as intended, but nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make me stop playing. Satisfaction mechanic and relations between characters should be more impactful. Spy system is interesting and you can do amazing things with it, but your spies need a bit of luck to get hired by other factions to make it worthwhile.

Music is great in this game. There are many tracks i think and each of them different that I dont hear them repeat too often even when playing long sessions for many hours. Music in battle is more tense and during campaign its more calm, pleasant for ears. There are also cool options to choose from, like changing colour palettes you can use Romance palette while playing in Records mode, etc. There are unit cards and alternative unit cards, english or chinese voiceovers with english subtitles. Not everyone might like it, but characters do a bit trashtalking during battles, some lines are a bit cringe, but I mostly like them.

TLDR: As long TW fan (my first game was Medieval 1) I can really recommend this game. It isn't flawless, but it is probably the best release of CA game in the studio history. Battles are good, campaign is great and character focus is making this game a bit more interesting. Few small patches and mods should make this a masterpiece.

I guess this is what you get for buying a game within a month of release nowadays....


Edit:

Haven't really experienced any bugs since the last 2 updates. There a still a few balance issues like cav being super OP and stuff but it's overal it's pretty good.

I have really been enjoying my campaign as gongsun zan so far. I also really like how you can recruit characters from factions that have perished or through marriage.

The management of settlements and diplomacy has been put up a peg, giving so much depth which work hand in hand with the Reform Tree (basically tech tree but much cooler). The battles are amazing to fight and run extremely well. The characters are all individually interesting and work extremely well into Romance mode (which I believe is the best mode).

Now I loved the Warhammer games while many Veterans didn't but I feel like this is a great all round game for those who love the historical titles and those who liked the hero aspect of Warhammer, while giving a strong entry point for anyone wanting to get into the series.

Total War : Three Kingdoms. What an amazing game to play, literally a breath taking experience. I've played them all, every total war, and after about 50+ hours of gameplay i have finally decided to put this up on the mantle of my favorite TW game in the entire series. 

Why? Because it's so believable and fun--- i feel connected to my empire with all the little intricacies this game has to offer that no other total war title has before. The UI is also beautiful to play around with and not at all cumbersome, the artwork is spectacular and the battles are exactly what i've come to expect from a total war game. Every facet of empire management is enjoyable and intuitive, economy is so much more diverse and deeper than ever before (like way deeper). Character gear makes customization awesome and easy to understand. Everything about this game is super comprehensible and easy but fits together to make one complex and beautiful puzzle.

I was ready to be so harsh on this game; and there are a few things about the game not worth mentioning really that bug me,  but it is truly outstanding and enjoyable to play. 

Absolutely recommend to anyone a fan of the series or a fan of strategy games. This is the ultimate.

Improvements:
+Great optimization, game runs very well
+Story events are faithful to the traumatic period of Three Kingdoms and characters are very well fleshed out 
+The Chinese voice acting is phenomenal
++Gameplay and AI is varied, every playthrough feels different
+++Deep town building and character management. Winning battles is only half the victory, better kingdom management will go a long way in winning the war.
+++Diplomacy that works and makes sense! This is a rarity in strategy games these days.

Now the not so good...
-English voice acting isn't the best
-Not much improvement in AI during battles
-The world map can be a confusing mess as everything can seem blended together

Closing thoughts:
This is the best Total War after Warhammer. I hope CA keeps some of the improvements(notably the diplomacy and the kingdom management) for their future titles.

My expectations were based upon their other games and this one blows them away by comparison.   While it's true that the majority of Total War games get tweaks to the mechanics this one has been completely revamped as far as campaign style goes.  Now, for fans of the Era of the 3Kingdoms (set around 190AD or CE depending on which generation you are) you may be a bit disappointed that there aren't any naval battles, as the WU had naval superiority in that time, however, they have redone the diplomacy, different factions have different abilities, you can choose to rank up your title quickly or slowly depending on the buildings you create, clans have different troops... they have trebuchet units.. omg the trebs are amazinngggg but lets just do this in a list format. 
Everything is colour coded, based on the particular stat or building type or unit type.
Diplomacy: (Trade) you can trade gold, can trade food, can trade ancillaries, territories, and make trade agreements. Everything gets points and it's much easier to manage because you can see the points instead of them being hidden.
(friends)  form coalitions, form military alliances, can make NAPS (non agression pacts), allow military access, vassalize other factions
(war) declare war, declare military alliance war, and sue for peace, you can even try to intimidate others to get what you want (failing makes you declare war though)
Spying: you can send spies into other factions, you can use them to steal items from other factions, spy on their military movements, hinder their movement range, open castle gates (alot of the stuff from other games really), make their unit turn traitor if it's leading an army and get the unit stack (not during battle), you can even start a civil war if your spy gets to a high office position.
Tech Tree: well technically (hehehe) it's not a tech tree, it's reforms, but it looks like a tree, special units, special buffs, buildings, even reforms to make your officers like you more, and there is far more choice available of how you want to do things. (well actually the yellow turbans get techs)
Officers: 5 styles of officers (not including the Yellow Turbans who have their own 3 unique types) 5 stats on each, you can even make them legendary officers if they get 100 in a stat.  There are 5 types of ancillaries with 4(5 really) types of ranking, common, bronze, silver, gold(legendary/unique) and also pieces from sets which give more bonuses when equipped with the full sets. (these are noted by a green border) there are Weapons, Armour, Horses/Mounts, Followers, and Items.

Wordier version: If you've played any of the Total War games this should feel pretty familiar to you. At the same time, there are some significant changes that mark it as a different beast than both the standard 'historical' TW games and the Warhammer games. Some of the changes are great, some... not so great. It's still tasty, though.  Even if you haven't played TW games this is worth a buy since it's a hugely fun beasty that's pretty easy to learn. I'll break down the specifics below. 

Pros: 
[list]
    [*]The game is gorgeous and the art style really hits its mark. 
    [*] It runs very smoothly. Even when there were a bunch of factions running around the map, it didn't take anywhere near as long for the computer to go through turns as it did in the Warhammer games. I also has low load times for its quick-save and quick-load system. 
    [*]Unit statistics are now much more granular; units don't just have an 'attack' and a 'defense' value, they have different defensive abilities vs missle and meele attacks, and so on. They most likely existed on previous games but were hidden, but TWTK makes them explicit. 
[*] While there are pretty generic troop roles and there aren't really faction specific units, there is enough variation in the types of spearmen you can field, for example, that only very basic army configurations seem 'samey'. The end game units feel properly epic.  
[*] The addition of duels to the Romance mode is excellent! I thought it was gimicky when I first read about it, but it works really well in the game  (although not all enemy generals will agree to a duel) 
[*] Having different classes of generals actually works really well and makes you consider what type of composition you'd like. You can have a set of dueling / brawling monsters, but without a support general, you won't be able to initiate night battles, which are absolutely essential in many situations. 
[*] Paper-doll style inventory; you can change a general's weapon, armor, mount, follower, and item. It's a nifty system that I found myself liking a lot. 
[/list]

Meh: 
[list]
[*] Armies no longer have one leader, they're broken up into a maximum of three mini-armies that fit together into one larger army, each mini-army (called a retinue) is led by one general. In practice that means that you will have some generals with abilities that affect the whole army, and some that just affect their individual retinue. It can be annoying to have a bunch of melee units, half of whom are pretty fast because one general has an ability that boosts his retinue's speed, and another half that are noticably slower. Keeping your entire army in formation and/or timing charges properly is much more difficult as a result. 
[*] Management - while the game technically has provinces, you can only really do anything with them if you assign a general to them as an administrator. And you can only have a small number of admins. And admins cost additional upkeep. 
[*] It takes new units an amount of time to muster. So even after you've spent the cash to buy a new set of troops, you'll need to wait several turns while the new units fill up, pretty much using the same mechanics as if you were replenishing damaged units. It's... odd. 
[*] You need to complete research in order to build most buildings above a very basic tier, and you need to have built buildings up to a basic tier in order to do further research down their branch. It's a very odd way of doing things and it's a bit annoying to be locked out of certain buildings until you research the right prerequisites. 
[*] There isn't enough information to differentiate how some units' functions are different. For instance, there's a missile unit in the game whose function is listed as ""bombardment"" and one that's listed as ""suppression"".  Some melee units have the tag of ""assault"" and others ""front line"". What are ""bombardment"" and ""suppression"", how does an ""assault"" unit differ from a ""front line"" unit? Fuck if I know, and there doesn't seem to be any tooltips for those sorts of role descriptors. I suppose you could try looking it up in the glossary, but that gets real annoying real fast. 
[*] Your generals are evidently pretty darn picky about everybody else in the game, and will have some pretty strong personal feelings about everybody else they could possibly be paired up with in an army. There are times when you absolutely need to reinforce an army with a particular general and their retinue, but then all the generals in the army will get all pissed off at each other. Hell, this even happens in your faction's court - the wife of my faction's leader ended up hating her own son.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]. 
    [*]Diplomacy. Holy shit, diplomacy. there are a million and one factions crammed into a pretty small space and they all have pretty strong opinions on pretty much everything you might do with one of the other factions. Plus, evidently everybody and their sister has decided that getting/becoming vassals is the way to do things. And then there's the Trustworthyness system. Some of it is old hat for TW players, like if you have a non-aggression pact with a nation and then immediately break it and declare war, you'll be viewed as less than trustworthy by the other factions. But remember that I mentioned vassals are now much more important? Well... sooner or later your vassal(s) will be attacked and you'll have the option of defending them and losing trustworthyness or abandoning them... and losing trustworthyness and a vassal to boot. Defending your vassals against wars of aggression should *not* lose you the respect of other factions.  
    [*]Trade; The way the economics of the game stack up, you will absolutely need to set up trade pacts and/or vassals to have any hope of fielding a proper number of armies.   But unlike previous TW games, you have a very limited number of trade pacts that you can make and saving slots often doesn't make sense since the other factions have a very limited number of slots too, and they tend to fill up very quickly. 
[*] Egos - characters are generally not at all happy just leading an army. Oh no, they want increased honors, titles, offices in the realm, and for you to take them out on date-nights more often (okay, that last bit isn't true). But they will throw a fit and storm off, leaving your faction, if you don't stroke their egos. Some character traits make this worse, and some will dull their ambition, but most of them have some sort of desire for bigger and better.  Well, those titles and offices cost money. Lots of money. 
[*] Agents... there aren't any. Assassins, spies, diplomats, etc, are all gone. Now you only have a limited number of slots for spies, and they have to be your generals that you then lose the ability to use since they become embedded with the enemy in their court or their armies. I also couldn't figure out any way to recall them, so once you've made a general into a spy,  it looks like they're gone forever. You can duplicate some of the functions that spies served in the previous TW games, but you need to build up two different types of 'spy points' (whatever they call 'em) in order to complete most actions, and it takes multiple turns to build up those points. Each different class of general also only has the option to use certain types of spy actions. While assassination may be possible (I'm honestly not sure), I didn't see it in my options lists. There's also the fact that your spies have a disturbingly common tendency to defect to the factions that you've embedded them in. In those situations, the game will tell you that your spy is in imminent danger of being converted by the faction its embedded with and warn you that you need to secure their loyalty, but then there's pretty much no mechanic to actually do that.

The good: This is probably the best all around total war game ever made so far. While I personally think Warhammer is the best, I have to admit that functionally, this game is all around superior. The diplomacy (with a caveat) is by far the biggest improvement over all other previous total war games. The caveat being that when you get near the ""end game"" it no longer means anything and there is no reason to make peace with anyone because 1) your allies will hate you for making peace with enemies and 2) your enemies will declare war next turn anyway so its a lose lose. 

That being said, the diplomacy at every stage leading up to the end game is a massive improvement over previous editions. Additionally, the new recruitment system is better in that you can immediately raise armies but they take several turns to ""muster"". The mustering time can be reduced with ""reforms"" which are equivalent to technologies in previous games. 

Battles are basically the same as every previous total war game and in all honesty, the battle AI is probably the same as it was in the original shogun. The AI still does the exact same thing of spread you out paper thin and go for the flanks. This means that if you outnumber the enemy you're almost guaranteed to win unless their units are several tiers above yours. It also means that if you're outnumbered you just need to use cavalry to smash their ranged while reorganizing your melee for the most favorable matchups. 

Three Kingdoms also has two functional game modes. One gives you the ""traditional"" total war experience whereas ""romantic"" makes all your ""Hero"" characters akin to demi-gods. In some cases you will have hero units killing as many as 500 of the enemy (or your) troops in a battle. This is up to personal preference obviously which version you like. 

The personality management system is also a new fun addition. Basically your generals don't all get along (who would have thought) so its important to manage them by creating harmony rather than putting together 3 dudes (or gals) who want to strangle each other to death. Also, generals come in different types. The type of general provides access to different abilities (cool) applies a bonus to different types of units (cool) and also is limited to certain unit types (I personally dislike this, I thought the bonus or no bonus was good enough but some people might like this feature) This means you need to really understand how your army composition works (or doesn't work) with the unit types and generals you have available, and fight it accordingly.

My biggest complaints with the game are the following:

1) diplomacy is meaningless once you get to the ""three emperors stage""

2) the AI still cheats with limitless funds, especially late game

3) Once a battle is about to be joined you can ""quick-save"" but say for example you want to take a break and fight it later you can't actually just save and quit right there. You have to quick-save, let the AI fight it (which means you probably lose) then quit and reload your quick save. Why in the hell  can't you just save and quit and fight a battle later? I don't know, I'm not a dev but I thought this was a pretty dumb aspect of the game. I've encountered it enough times that it got on my nerves enough to write it here. Others may not even notice.

4) This is one of my other big gripes. Say for example you have a settlement and 2 armies. You position 1 army in the settlement and then the 2nd army outside to support. The AI shows up with 3 armies. They encircle your settlement with 1, and attack your outside supporting army with a 2nd. When the pre-battle screen shows up, your single army outside the walls is now facing all three enemy armies but your army inside the walls along with the garrison can't reinforce. This makes absolutely no sense at all. If anything, at LEAST the army that is encircling the settlement should not be able to join the fight because the ONLY reason the armies behind the walls cant sally forth is because they've been encircled. If the encircling army can join in and reinforce, then by extension no one is keeping the army inside the garrison, actually inside, and they should also be able to support. This basically means that everytime you defend near a settlement you're actually better off NOT getting behind the walls because the AI isn't going to attack them anyway, and you effectively prevent yourself from supporting any other armies or allies nearby if you go inside the walls. This happens very frequently so the AI is clearly programmed to take advantage of the mechanic but it is neither a logical nor realistic mechanic. 

Overall its a great game. It's probably the best game in the series. If i could give a star rating I'd give it a 4 out of 5.",1559611476,1559612026,True,0.0,True,False,False,872,en

Good story and highly enjoyable game play, I like that they added in region trading again, a food system, and population growth, which altogether add an extra layer of depth to the game. I would say that the only thing that bugs me is the new Retinue system. Whereas in previous total wars you were able to recruit all units, now only certain generals can recruit certain units, taking away some of the freedom in building your armies. In addition, you are now forced to have 3 general units per army, which is rather annoying while playing Records mode when you feel less inclined to have your generals charge into hell and are now forced to have 3 units sitting back and watching the battle. 
Aside from that one complaint, it's a great game and I highly recommend it, and the good news is that Radious mod will probably allow complete freedom in recruiting units, thereby eradicating my one complaint.",1559606801,1559606801,True,0.0,True,False,False,182,en

I was pleasantly surprised when every installed, and worked smoothly, and I was even more pleased to find minimal bugs throughout gameplay. That it's super well optimized is testament to how delaying a game for a few months, to polish it up, is actually a good idea.  

I'm several campaigns in, and it's been a lot of fun. The campaign dynamics are a huge improvement from any other TW game, the campaign map itself is beautiful (along with just about everything else). Outside of the few flaws, the game is, overall, fantastic, but I will touch up on the few flaws...

For one, unit diversity is lacking. Now I'm not expecting anything even close to Warhammer or even Rome, for diversity, as it's all set in one relatively isolated area, but I wish there was still some more. Similarly, I feel that the ""look"" of many of the units could be adjusted. Its very difficult to tell any difference between Saber Militia and Saber Infantry (outside of the saber infantry having a lamellar vest, while the saber militia don't). Many of the units simply don't look that cool... and something very simple, like spreading out some of that cool looking armor seen on the generals among some of the more elite units, and moving the mediocre looking armor, seen on the elite units, to some of the mid-tier units. Give those infantry some bloody helmets, basically. 

Also, battles are still too quick. Some are slower, now, but I still feel that once the main line starts thrashing, its over pretty quickly. 

And lastly, the final glaring thing that makes the late game a little less enjoyable is the lack of late game legendary characters. Most of the legendary characters (and I mean the truly unique ones, not ordinary chaps you can buff to legendary status) are present at the start of the campaign, and will eventually die off. Sure, there are a few that can be recruited for several factions, and a few of the warlords have unique children that need to come of age, but I find that if you're not playing one of the posterboy factions, by late game, your legendary characters have mostly died off, and you'll be lucky to have one or two of them. Hence, I hope they fix this with DLC and flesh out the late game more by bringing in some of those later period characters into the recruitment pool. 

But anyways... overall, fantastic. Don't regret a thing with buying it. 9/10 final rating.",1559575940,1559575940,True,0.0,False,False,False,433,en

    Overall:9.2/10

    Art: .9.5/10      
    Music: 9.8/10
    Strategy: 9/10
    Gameplay 9/10   
    
      
     Pros: Beautiful and precisely accurate design of art, fascinating background music and sound effect, attractive game system, and great experience in a war battle.
     Cons: Lacking portraiture in contrast with other games with the same kind, and the 3D models of them don't fit their portrait, and more they look ugly to some extent.   The gender for Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao is wrong, they are famous for their beauty in the Three Kingdoms period, but in the game, they are male and look lame. In addition, Chinese people do not look like the appearance in the game, it fell a little weird, for this part please find references from Koei game.  In the end , the game is getting a little boring as you enter the late game, for there are a massive cities to management and lot of trade to control  with repetitive operation.
     
     Suggestions: Adding more portraiture and skills for the character and adding different backgrounds music for various influences. 
     Please Simplify the flow in the late game such as uniform the construction of city with auto management by the prime or magistrate. 
     Adding a calculator input when the player is changing the trade the number.

     Expects: Adding Water-battle, because many famous battles such as Battle of the Red Cliff was fought on the river.  
     Adding more geography constructions such as Hu Lao fort or Qi Shui fort，because they were playing a very critical role in the ancient Chinese battles.
     Offering a choice to the player to decide whether he or she needs to declare their emperor because the emperor was sensitive to the country in that time and it usually depended on right political time, perfect situation and people's support. It was common for a vassal to not to claim the emperor instantly for political considerations. 
I am expecting a well balanced and more abundant gameplay system.

Big props to Creative Assembly for taking extra time to polish the game and listening to the community. It is rare for a big developer to go back to being awesome after disappointing the fans many times. Things like this give hope for Bethesda, EA and Ubisoft. I am very glad that his game sold well over a million copies in the first week, as it shows that releasing a (mainly) single player game adhering to the highest standards is greatly rewarded.

As for the game: Gotta go back to playing so no time to write a long review, if you are a TW buff then this game is a must, if you are not then I can honestly say this is by far the best RTS/TBS game released on Steam in the past few years so what are you waiting for?

If you love TW : buy this
If you love shogun 2 : MUST BUY THIS
if you love the romance of three kingdom universe : MUST BUY THIS
if you ONLY love world confflict TW such as medieval, rome or warhammer : wait for sale or skip altogehter

Campaign

While patchs and tweaks  are  definitely required, it is an actual improvement over the past TW, coalition asnd alliances meant something, faction special mechanic is actually unique and helpfull.

Be careful about your friend though, they might steal a town in the name of friendship , think very hard about who is going to be your friend.

Food is very important as some faction have a loot of gold but almost no food, you can easily give them food to ease the deal

You can upgrade unit by ""swapping"" them, like medieval 2 when you equip your miltia with up with better armor , unlike medieval 2 you will not feel personal emotion to any unit since they are becoming different unit altogether since you are swapping them not upgrading them

Battle

This game show the final limit of this engine, while everything is detail and beautiful the unit collusion is kinda bad as you can see soldier sliding and act weird 

Some of your cav might die on charge even though you charge a light infantry from behind especially  if the cav lack the mass

Stabbing axe animation is still presence

unit variation is lacking but kinda make sense since everyone use same doctrine,of course there are some unique unit but mostly it is up to better stats or traits

My favorite faction has to be Dong Zho or one of the Yellow Turban Revolution factions (those that remind me of Ikko Ikki, the best faction ever created in a Total War game as it is unique. 

I wish there were more heavily armored units like shown in loading screen, because Asian armour looks great. Waiting for more campaign DLCs hopefully we get to invade Korea which is teased in the campaign map.

First, the game is really user friendly. characters, unit types, building types, and reforms (technologies) are all color-coded to clearly see what your choices will impact. You get basic stats from hovering on anything and you can usually get optional detailed statistics if you are into that kind of thing.

The different characters and units are all really well designed. Each type of general brings their own different style of play on the battlefield, and they each bring their own retinue of units which I think works really well to efficiently and thematically manage troops. After playing TW Warhammer I thought I would miss the unit diversity, but so far I just don't mind having a core group of units shared by each faction. It helps to know what to expect in a battle and have some consistency rather than trying to figure out how to deal with dinosaurs one minute and dragons the next (not that I don't enjoy that too). Also the familiarity of the units helps to appreciate the subtle differences between factions.

The AI seems good to me, both on the battlefield and in the campaign. Campaign mode is quite challenging. It is hard at first, also, to learn all of the different factions, because several share the same surname and only have a couple letters unique in their given name, but I got used to it midway through the campaign and started being able to keep track of everyone. This was the first campaign I actually finished since I think Medieval II total war. They managed to keep the intensity and interest throughout the whole thing, which is a dramatic improvement for me. Also the game is very stable for only being out a week.

Excellent game overall. I sincerely doubt you will regret buying it, even at full price. I've already started up a second campaign and every time I stop playing I think about the game. I have a problem.

So far ive really enjoyed the game seems to be a solid advancement in the series. General dueling is cool, expanded gear systems for each general as well make it a bit more rpg like as well. So.. im going to tell you about the one negative experience ive had within this game, and the real reason of why im writing this review... so here goes.

               They added a new feature to the diplomacy system so that if you declare war shortly after breaking treaties or without breaking the treaties first, you receive a penalty towards your trustworthiness. (this does exist in other total war titles but is definitely more apparent when making decisions in this one) Your trustworthiness determines how willing factions are to working with you and making the yugest trade deals in history.. believe me. so it does make sense to me that if i tell you that i wont attack you, then declare on you the next turn, that i would seem to be untrustworthy to the rest of china..  So anyways, I had been land locked for quite a few turns and wanted to expand. So i proceeded to break off all of my agreements with a neighbor whose territory i wanted and waited out the 6 turns for the penalties to go away... Okay, great ive managed to avoid becoming untrustworthy by going through this process.. Armies were in place and ready to go, so i declared war, marched my army in and seized a city, Perfect! and no penalties in sight.. they had one temple left that i couldnt reach that turn, so I end my turn. My next turn arrives and i go back to my army and prepare to march up to take the temple which is when i noticed something odd.. When i click to attack the temple it asks if i want to declare war on the faction which is when i realize that out of no where... IM NO LONGER AT WAR WITH THEM........ So what happend??? Apparently the faction decided to become a vassal of another faction, which effectively nullifies any existing wars they have (it doesnt notify you of this either).. and the game proceeds to act as if this ""peace"" is something that you have agreed upon! The real kicker here is if you decide to go ahead and declare war AGAIN towards that very same faction you just declared on 1 turn before you will receive massive trustworthiness penalties... FOR WHAT?! how does this make any sense? simple answer is that it doesnt.. so discouraged and not able to claim the 1 remaining temple city of my neighbor that im now no longer at war with, i decide to just cut my losses and look for a new target to avoid becoming untrustworthy.. Find one, Break treaties, Wait 6 turns, Declare war. March toward my new enemies territory. End my turn....... THEY BECOME A VASSAL BEFORE MY NEXT TURN NULLIFYING MY WAR INSTANTLY BEFORE I COULD SEIZE A SINGLE TERRITORY... how is this a mechanic?!.. After it happening 2 times in a row and making a small dent in my forehead with a facepalm, i decided that i didnt care anymore. So I re-declared war on the very same faction that i just declared on 1 turn prior and took MASSIVE trustworthiness penalties.. i did manage to snag several of their cities and am now one of the most untrustworthy people in china at a -40 some trustworthiness. All that time wasted avoiding these penalties for the AI to abuse a feature. This has to be one of the worst thought out features of this game and the computer seems to do it quite a bit causing you to be land locked 99% of the time unless you dont care about diplomacy and being untrustworthy and just warmonger every faction around you.. good luck having allies, creating coalitions, creating your own vassals, or doing anything with the new shiny expanded diplomacy system because if they dont trust you.. they wont deal with you. I really do hope they address this aspect of the game because its really quite game breaking to follow all of their rules to engage in a war to have it end without your consent and be penalized for wanting to continue it.. All in all this is a great game and i would recommend getting it if youre a long time total war fan or like the three kingdoms era of china.",1559516195,1559516195,True,0.0,False,False,False,773,en

Not the Best nor Worst. If you like Total War game, then I think you would have some fun with it... because I am still having fun while playing it.

But if you are ""Romance of Three kingdom"" fan, then I wouldn't recommend the game right now.
The game did add something like story progression, to give people a chance to enjoy the story of ROTK, however because the game is basically Sandbox, it is very hard to reach the goal to continue the story.
For example, if my goal is to confederate one specific faction to continue the story, then that specific faction will do everything to stop you from confederate them. Sometime they suddenly become vassal to other faction who are clearly weaker or in same power level, and sometime they suddenly wage a war with you, doesn't matter if you are in friendly relationship or in non-aggressive term with them or not.
Also there are too less ""Unique Legendary"" character in my opinion. Maybe because they will come out as DLC? I am not sure because even the character that I thought will come out as ""Unique Legendary"" is just a ""Generic Legendary"" Character.

The best thing that I see is the AI. They are so smart both on campaign map and in the battlefield. Normally my play style is quite a passive on the early game, build a good foundation of economics, strengthen my back door (public order). However Three Kingdoms has changed my pace a lot. it is quite accurate with the romance, everyone need to be quite aggressive, capture the minor faction, rebel city, Han city, before it's belong to any powerful warlord.

Changing from Europe geography to China is also game changing. In European map you find that you will have a battle for 2 or 3 front lines. You can rely on the natural barrier such as mountain range, river, or desert to shield from enemy. So what have change with China ? Of course at the eastern and North eastern China, you will be in a middle of power thirsty war lord, which you will need to utilize a new diplomatic system. There are so many choices that you can choose which i think it's even better than previous game.

In all other total war games Calvary is either very weak but super strong at flanks.. yes.. But in Three Kingdoms, when the horses are stuck in a infantry unit fighting, and you have archers shooting at the cavalry it has 0 effect. Super weak might as well throw the bow.. In all other Total War when the cavalry is in combat archers, slingers, javelins, skirmishers can kill them in seconds without even telling them to aim specifically for the Cavalry... because why? a dude on a horse sticks out like a sore thumb in a crowd of infantry.. 

Diplomacy took a while to understand.. not good, clutter on the screen, so many fucking names, and THE NAMES CHANGE WHEN THE LEADER DIES....

English is not my native language, sorry for mistakes. 
I must say that this is not my ideal climate for strategy games, especially Total Wars. I always was ROME and MEDIEVAL big fun. I had a great time with Warhammer but still not best of all. Somewhere between all of them, Shogun 2 appears, and it was for me surprising satisfying and playful and now... Now there is Three Kingdoms. Games which I believe can be a little bit hard for any no-Asian player at the beginning (to figure it out all strange sounding names and ""country's"" ), oriental, and because I do not have almost any knowledge about this period in history od Asia. It can also be not so ""personal"" (you know, you can't find your country or area where you live) but still... Amazing.

This is by now one of the best (if not the best) Total War I played. What CA did, and the path they choose to develop diplomacy and strategy on a big map is the best choice ever for this game. New Total War has almost all what was I looking for in old games and what I was trying to ""repair:"" by downloading mods. I believe that all next games from them in Total War series can be only better if they will be developing AI and diplomacy in Total Wars.

I am a veteran of Total Wars, and I know all of them and play from the time I was a kid. Right now I do not have so much time to play games (adult life suck as you know... ;) ) but for this game...

The campaign AI and diplomacy is fucked. One example on how the AI is fucked. I was playing Dong Zhou which you are in a war with mostly everyone, Kong Rong which is completely on the other side of the map and is in war with like 5-6 factions while he has only 5 counties. This fuck dares sends an army to attack one of my cities while completely exposing himself to his enemies and he loses 3 counties. His full stack army achieved nothing, there military supplies dried out as soon he stepped on my land but he still pressed onward. Then my army showed up and he just went back home. I stopped chasing him when he started running in marched stance which is another annoying problem this game has. You need about two armies to trap and destroy one army in marched stance running all over the place causing havoc. This kind of shit happens all the time, the AI completely fucking them self over just to lets say capture your farm and they're exposing there capital. You especially see this when you are a superior power and at war with multiple people. I know this is a problem with AI in other Total Wars but i feel it has gotten worse. 


Now the diplomacy and some random shit

They added some new stuff which is really nice but most of the time you dont even get the option to do these new things. Trading the equipable items is pretty overpowered in diplomacy, if you gather enough of useless shit you can trades these things for cities and about anything. The shit part for you is that other factions never have these things to trade, so getting a rare item from them is impossible in diplomacy. I dont know how many times i been cucked by Yuan Shao. You would have 1 turn left to finish off some enemy and..... Yuan fucking Shao! Will come out of nowhere and vassalize them and ending the war -_-  Leaving you with a decision to either declare war again but fighting Yuan Shao and all of his vassals or leaving them alone. My first tip when playing the campaign, kill that shit Yuan Shao first. Heres another decent size problem. Lets say you have a vassal and that vassal gets declared war on by Cao Cao, Your two options are either leaving the vassal by them self with the war which makes you untrustworthy or you declare war on Cao Cao, the problem is that if you have a peace treaty or a non-aggression pact with Cao Cao and you declare war on them, you will become untrustworthy. So either way you will be hated and untrustworthy. Just pretty much fuck non-aggression pacts and peace treaties, this happens in some other ways too so you have to be extremely careful with your non-aggression pacts and you might as well finish off your opponent, dont bother with a peace treaty. If you are playing Yuan Shao good luck, you can never depend of vassals or really allies in general to help you out in wars. I feel like they are honestly pointless in being a assistance. Alliances and coalitions are only good to me when i need to keep a faction from declaring war on me and i put my focus somewhere else. I know this is kind of a stretch but the AI cheats are out of control. The AI literally can have like 3 counties and hold about 3-4 full stack armies, if the player had that amount of counties and that amount of armies he/she would be seriously in the negative. I feel like no matter how many counties i take the enemy seems too recover completely fine and by the time you get to end game it just gets annoying and its a chore.

I could go on almost forever on the things i dislike and there might be easy solutions too them but this is what i experienced in my hours of playing, the reason im kind of mixed on this review is because this game is really fun but the most aggravating total war i ever played. I dont know if its because i love the Romance of the three kingdoms so much but damn this shit is addicting. 

-Seeing the legendary names in the game from the story is really exciting to see. 
-I love the duals, something i been wanting from the other total wars. 
-The building feels a lot better.
-Equipping items on your character is fun and they appear in battle
-The faction stories are fun to play along with
-I love the yellow turbans, i hope you guys do future DLC like this
-the game looks amazing

Im sure there is other stuff i like but those are the mains. Im defiantly going to continue playing the game, its a lot of fun but fuck this AI. If you read this thank you for putting up with my terrible writing and my vulgarness.

Great effort. I usually dislike a title setting that is restricted to a single culture (like Shogun), but this surprised me in every way. The new creativity in 'Heros' system is awesome and  perfectly links it the experience I have had in Dynasty Warriors.

I've put thousands of hours in combination over the games (an embarrassing amount, really) and I have to say Three Kingdoms is my favorite. 

Diplomacy actually feels robust and like it actually matters (rather than just declining literally everything the AI ever proposes like in previous games), the AI actually recognize that you are stronger than them and will band together to put a stop to something that threatens their common existence (though it is different from the previous games where *everyone* on the map would declare war...). Alliances are feasible and yes... THEY FINALLY BROUGHT BACK ULTIMATUMS!

Battles are, of course, grand in scale and I've had many where I was on the edge of my chair because the fate of nations hinged on the battle. Armies are very structured in how you can recruit them and each has strengths and weaknesses to exploit.

The game looks incredible on the campaign map and in battle and is optimized much better than previous games. Granted, I have high end hardware, but I have played it on some average hardware machines (for science) and it runs just fine and still looks great.

Plus... Generals DUELING on the battlefield??? My jaw dropped when I watched the first one. Crazy.

My ONE criticism is stability. I write this review as I was finally kicked off the game (probably a good thing at this point) due to it crashing. Fortunately autosaves are a thing and I save with a certain degree of paranoia, but it's crashed a few times today.

Pros.
+ Fantastic battles.
+ Amazing graphics.
+ Smooth running Game.
+ immersion.
+ Diplomacy that works and feels real.
+ Rpg elements with heroes.
+ Ui, tech tree, buildings, heroes, built around the era and culture.
+ Basic family tree. (great starting point)
+ Strong early and mid game and an alright end game.
+ Yellow turbans <3.


Cons
- Family tree is a little basic needs deeper mechanics and tracking.
- Individual factions need more unique mechanics to differentiate in campaign and more unique units overall.
- Creation of children in game is picky and currently has some flaws. 
- Overall just more polish. ( no game is perfect)
- Deserted areas of the map need factions asap.
- End game lacking a rewarding feeling of truly creating a dynasty.

I firmly believe future updates and dlc will fix all cons and add to all the pros.

Recommended 10/10.

I played Rome, Rome II, Shogun 2, Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon etc. Then SEGA and CREATIVE ASSEMBLY started moving towards Warhammer and fictional games.

I also liked Rome and Attila with about 500h each, but was sceptical against warhammer, which in the end I also liked but didn't put in as many hours. Now for 3K, I was afraid that they will include too many Warhammery things in order to appeal to the new won WH fans. 

But wow, they did everything right in this game. Right after launch, the game was playable without major bugs, which already surprised me. 3K walks a thin line between appealing to old school fans and bringing in fresh, new mechanics. And it came out awesome. The new recruitment / army system is a fresh start but feels great and also makes sense. Military supplies are a new mechanic similar to ""integrity"" in earlier titles, but also that works out perfectly, with not being to tough but also not being too easy.
Diplomacy is at its peak. The best system I've ever seen in Total War. You have many options, AI seems to actually care about it now and you cannot abuse it. 
Strategic map is also good, I've found it difficult so far to build up strong economic cities, as many factors like population, income and synergic boosts all interplay, and found it generally leaving too little money for armies and characters. But maybe I'm just not good enough at that yet (or build too expensive armies). Characters in general have been overworked, and their relationships may change over time leading to unexpected outcomes, forcing you to adapt and plan ahead. 
I've only played romance mode so far, and while I enjoy the general duels I find it hard to predict the outcome, and (certain) generals have been made a bit too strong in my opinion, tearing apart multiple units while taking little damage, similar to strong monsters in WH. But thats just a minor dislike, maybe I'll like records even better.

All in all I've never been as impressed with a TW at launch like this. And I definitively rate it a must buy. Get your copy now, you can continue browsing reviews while it downloads.",1559398787,1559398787,True,0.0,True,False,False,362,en

Like the tabletop, Warhammer strategy is focused around the battles, the main draw is how many different units you can take into the match and all the insane army compositions you can have. With Three Kingdoms you get many layers of politics and infrastructural planning to deal with that just don't exist in Warhammer. There's a learning curve even when you have  experience with strategy.

The focus is definitely on political intrigue. Armies follow the rock-paper-scissor system more closely which helps me keep track of battles, but the choices you make as to what faction you attack and who you co-operate with have to be very well considered. You want to appease your powerful allies in every way you can, sometimes this leads you to stabbing a less powerful friend in the back or you force peace with an old enemy, you have to carefully manoeuvre around expanding your influence and power without upsetting the wrong people.

Presentation here is fantastic, it takes a minimalistic Asian-inspired approach that is instantly recognizable yet very aesthetically pleasing. They put a ton of information on screen but it doesn't feel overwhelming. Especially in battles I noticed how easy it was to see what it is going, the icons of armies shrink and fade into the background as they start routing, in keeping with the fact that they're not a threat anymore, units are drawn as rectangles instead of an amasment of dots, and there's tons more such changes to keep the UI as clean as possible at all times without hiding valuable information. Clearly a lot of effort went into this as it all just comes together beautifully.

That said, some of the menus can still be completely overwhelming. Once you start opening the detailed menus for your political relations or something it's easy to get confused. The team did their best to make it accessible for new players without sacrificing any of the depth that long-term players want to get into. One commander is recommended as a starting point since you will be guided through his first turns, the adviser can be set to maximum to explain to you what's going on at all times, you can make an information overlay appear at all times to show you what each button and icon does, and when press escape you get a brief overview of the shortcuts plus several tutorial videos to watch should you be even more confused. I have to say it really helped me. If you ever get confused just press on and make some mistakes. Yeah maybe by turn 40 you find out your city is going broke and you've accidentally betrayed your greatest ally, but there's really no way to prevent that. Try to keep playing despite fucking your own shit royally and enjoy the things that do work out, like cool battles and duels with your divine commander.

I've heard that many of the mechanics are entirely new to the series and I'll have to take that at face value, but I will say that diplomacy and campaigning just feel right in this game. They make complete sense. So right in fact that it sets a new standard for strategy in general. This game is more than another Total War, this really is the next evolvement of the genre. Significant strides were made in making strategy play more like it should, the team for this game are insanely good at what they do. Everything comes together, nothing feels out of place, so many new mechanics and they all just work perfectly. This title is a must-buy for 2019, that's for sure. Probably a 95 this game.

- Detailed characters classes system with a blend of RPG in term of equipment and relationship.
- Beautiful graphic and great optimization
- Its the ROTK period, and lots of ppl love it just by the settings.

Neutral :
- Combat remain pretty much the same with the Archer > Spear / Melee > Cavalry > Archer system with the addition of characters abilities. Personally, i still prefer the Warhammer titles combat style where we have very diverse armies

Cons :
- Frustrating recruitment / replenishment system. It take really long to replenish army without reform/abilities, and your newly recruited unit does not appear with full model. You actually have to wait a few turns for the new unit to be at full strength. Luckily, all units take only a turn to recruit this time
- Missile feel a bit OP this time with lots of killing power

Pro:
Amazing graphics and UI design
Truly immersive of war and combat system
Authentic Chinese voice over (probably better than most of the Chinese games made by Chinese out there)
Fully fleshed out character and general system
Diplomacy works and can make or break your dominance
Spy Network is fun to spend your extra resources on
Factions have their own unique play styles and traits (proxy war for Cao Cao, and trade mastery for Kong Rong)
Very addictive and hungry for next round!

Cons
Lack of unique portraits for the characters and generals (the worst offenders are probably female characters, Diao Chan and Daio Chao, Xiao Chao all have generic random generated faces), but I guess it can be easily fixed by future DLC updates

Having diplomacy as deep as it is really does make each round feel fresher and more unique than the last.

Review 2:
Good:
-Very nice artworks
-RPG elements, Characters focused
-Best diplomacy
-Replayability
-Good DLC
-Such strategy, very tactic, much wow

Bad:
-AIs cheat, cheat and cheat
-No Mod, no blood/gore/combat animation (so far)
-Many characters from Romance of 3 Kingdoms not included, yet many characters are auto-generated. Why?
-No Naval
-Siege battle is lame with one type of siege engine (trebuchet). Where is ladder tower, and other siege engines?

Conclusion: I recommend this game, it is fun to play. If you are a fan of Romance of Three Kingdoms, you will find the game somewhat disappointed as it is not portrayed very closely to what happened in the book.

Units never truely die... They take 2 turns to come back from the grave and do at the rank they ""died"" at. 

The units are recruited and come back at partial health like Thrones of Britannia.

For armies that are playing cat and mouse, being able to split an Amy up to cut them off is nice, albiet an obvious risk.

The yellow turbans, if no other faction, feel like easy mode on the battlefield as well as the grand strategy map... Even on very hard... 

The balance of power seem way off or for romance mode it does not account for all your heroes/commanders teaming up on the enemies one at a time whilst (de)buffing units.

The fact that if a unit dies you get it back 2 turns later makes the campaign easy as you just reinvest into your economy or new armies...

Shogun 2 with mods like darth mod is way more enjoyable to play, the ai doesn't have as many cheats it can exploit you with due to your ability to mount armies that can take on a base.

If you’re deeply interested in ancient China, like myself, you can play the “Romance” version of the campaign to fully enjoy all the added elements of politics, family, and history as I have been. However, if that is not your thing, you can play the “Total War” version of the campaign for a more traditional experience. Either way, the game is incredibly enjoyable. 

The AI is the best I’ve seen in some time. The battles are fluid and exciting, even more so than Shogun 2’s battles (IMO). You won’t experience huge lag and frame rate drops like you did in Empire. The campaign has a lot of new elements that add small details here and there that are very enjoyable for the overall realism and experience. Even though the map is centered around the unification of China only, they did an excellent job still making the campaign feel “grand” - it’s huge.

After playing several campaigns and beating the game on legendary I feel like i know the game inside out. And I can not stress this enough. This game is THE best total war game! By far! Every other game in the series pale compared to this. I don't know if i can go back to any of the old ones now...

I've been a long term total war fan but honestly i was never really hyped for this game. I didn't even plan to get the game to begin with. The setting didn't seem interesting to me. It seemed like the setting would be bland and without much personality. especially since there's not much variety in factions compared to other Total War titles. But holy **** was i wrong! I've fallen in love with a setting i never thought I'd be into. It's been a long time since a game has done that to me. The factions do have their own personality and do play differently. I applaud CA for making them feel unique and have tons of fun little meaningful details to them

If you're and old TW fan and have been hesítant of getting this game. Then you're just like me. I still bought it because I was curious. And i can safely say you won't be disappointed. 

To any player who've never played a Total War game before, this is the one to get. This is what every game in the series should be. It has set a new standard and set it high. You also won't be disappointed. 

[h1]What makes this game so great?[/h1]
[b]The historical setting[/b]
The year is 190 CE in China. The Han dynasty has fallen and China faces a long period of war and power struggle. Will you choose to play as Cao Cao the strategic genius? (and massive troll. You really need to watch some scenes from the Three kingdoms tv series from China. There's some hilarious scenes with this guy.) Or Liu Bei the hero of the people together with his two loyal brother (not by blood) Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. Or maybe as the Yellow Turbans who are tired of tyranny and greed and want a new beginning and a new way of life for China. 

The history behind these characters are very interesting and are reflected in this game very well. You will get attached to them and want to read more about them. There's so much personality, philosophy and fascinating conflict to explore. 

[b]The real-time battles[/b]
The units you get to play with might seem boring at first. And many armies might look the same. But this will change over the course of your campaign. There's a lot of variety and choices you can make when unlocking new units and they all serve a purpose.

The AI might seem as dumb as before. But, after closer inspection that's not the case. In reality they've actually made some very nice progress. Sure there's still flaws. But the problem is, this won't be true on the easier difficulties. Which tbh seems weird to me. If you play on harder difficulties the AI's armies are buffed and are also a lot smarter. This has never really been the case before. I feel like it should always as smart as it can be no matter if you play on normal or hard and up. 

In romance mode, which is my preferred mode, your generals are one strong unit with many different abilities and classes that makes them different from each other. They can duel other generals or just be a one man army if they're strong enough. They add a lot of strategic value and makes the battles a lot of fun. 

Archers feel a lot stronger in this game compared to other TW games. Using spears against cavalry has changed quite a bit by introducing charge reflecting. A stationary spear unit can reflect the damage output from cavalry back to them. Which makes it a bit harder to use, but more rewarding and fun to use at the same time. I like this change. 

[b]Campaign and diplomacy[/b]
The campaign map is very big and has a lot of strategic locations you will want to conquer. Cities are very customizable but generally you want to compliment the other commanderies in that region to get the most out of them. They've made this very easy to do by color coding everything. So this won't really be something you'll get a headache over. 

The same goes for the diplomacy which they've actually made good this time around! There's SO many options! And it's very easy to understand what other factions want and doesn't want! This has always been a massive frustration in other games in the series. I have always struggled and been frustrated with other titles. But not anymore. It's fun, intuitive and easy yet advanced. The most important part though is that diplomacy really matters. You won't do well if you ignore it. And you will have a lot of fun using it! Well done CA! 

I will end this by saying I'm very excited for the future of the series. They've put the bar extremely high with this game and anything close to this will be a masterpiece. Because, this is just that, a masterpiece.",1559295401,1561655305,True,0.5761706829071045,False,False,False,889,en

The Diplomatic system is a disaster for me.  I know that developers try to implement a  complex, grand diplomatic system which deserves the reputation of three kingdoms romance. But they failed. E.g. If your friend is invited to your enemy alliance,  you can't stop the war with him, no matter how good your relationship is(even with non-aggression compaction, military access, food trade). Since any diplomatic action has a ""price"" in this game, your wealthy enemy can easily turn your friends against you.

Pros
*Diplomacy isn't mostly irrelevant- most factions rely on some sort of diplomatic wrangling to last until the mid-game
*Three Kingdoms is much more difficult than past titles (only because there is so much more going on) but each campaign is wildly different than the last
*There are less turns wasted waiting for your cash to creep back up - there are more solutions for everything
*The battles are easy to navigate and keeping track of everyone is a breeze
*I ran mine with low graphics but extreme unit sizes and never had a single issue on my older laptop
*The Yellow Turban DLC is worth the buy (even though I received mine with a preorder) - they immediately became my favorite

Cons
*Normal bugs on release, some have already been fixed
*I found the tutorial a bit lacking, even for someone who has played all the total wars
*While beautiful, the reform layout is a bit vexing to sort out, especially when you don't have all the colors memorized yet
*Some factions are only worth playing in Romance mode and some only in Records


Overall they REALLY brought it back with this one.  I recommend buying even at full price.  It is a fun, challenging game that keeps you on your toes.

Military:
In general battles resemble Shogun 2 with its spear/sword/ranged/cavalry/siege basic archetypes. Units are arranged to maximize rock-paper-scissors match-ups, and generally volume wins. However there is the notable shake-up of:

-Romance Mode- this essentially makes the generals like heroes from Warhammer, for better or worse. Strong 1v1 generals will win battles, period. Dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from Warhammer. The AI is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot win, and even when they reject them you can simply right-click on them and get the same result. So far I have not seen any troops be effective against high-stat generals — it's common to outmaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squads.

Of course if you don't like that you can simply play Records mode, which I haven't tried yet.

-Roster-
Although all units fall into classic archetypes, there are more units than reviews insinuated. Most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology. I can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them. An example: auto-crossbow units from high-Cunning generals will grant you a highly cost-effective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general. This might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrison.

-Military Supply-
This is the largest difference from previous titles in terms of military. All armies have a pool of 100 supplies that slowly fills in your own territory and rapidly drains in enemy territory and during the winter — 30 lost to enemey territory, another 25 for winter (even in your own territory). Once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses. This can be improved with infrastructure and character traits, but without significant investments the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely high-risk. Aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion. This, combined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacements, forces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense. Gone are the days of spamming Ashigaru to handle an unexpected attack, or endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements. Likewise the AI can't use these strategies, solving the cat-and-mouse games everyone hated in Warhammer.

Strategy layer:
This is where I feel this game really shines compared to its predecessors. There are many new mechanics here that are brilliantly interlaced. One decision often begets 6 more, requiring lots of forethought.

-Commanderies (a.k.a. provinces)-
This has been made far more complicated than previous titles. The game features a massive web of building trees, each replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual one-problem-one-building method we're used to. Compounding this is the commanderies system — known as provinces in Warhammer, these are groups of territories that are designed to be held together. One territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildings, while attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree. Because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts. This adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system — with good relations the AI will gladly trade territories of equal value with you.

-Staff-
Managing your administration is a large component of 3K. Even with optimal buildings you will not have enough income without the right staff multiplying their benefits. Each staff's personality quirks will play heavily into what managing them will entail — in general you want to hire like-minded people to reduce conflict and maximize satisfaction, but it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy (vanguards are better for industry, commanders for peasants, etc). Black sheep can still be effective so long as they're kept away from their associates. Failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences — people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war. In my first run I found myself occasionally firing people I hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil over.

One final layer worth mentioning: all of these characters are persistent and historied, often having served other leaders before you. This mostly has implications with Espionage which I'm not experienced enough to talk about yet.

-Diplomacy-
In Shogun 2 all of the leaders seemed like schizophrenics with borderline disorder, refusing trade and breaking alliances randomly. In Warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all. From that low bar 3K has made massive improvements. Leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well. Diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any Total War or 4x.
The same diplomatic options from Shogun and Total War are present, but you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often. Items, payments, and marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreements, and territories can be traded to mutual benefit. Enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall. Cao Cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy wars.
The confederation system is the icing on the cake. Forging large confederations will require you to navigate carefully, as new members must be approved by a majority of existing ones, and voting in opposition of members will sour your relations. Furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak. That means order is important, and you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first. All of this complicates your expansionism, perhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an ally, or an ally's-ally, by attacking your borders.

Performance:
If you're a Total War veteran you know why this section is here. I'm playing on this rig and the game runs flawlessly on a 2k 144hz monitor and looks great even with swarms of units on screen. If you're new to Total War and don't have an SSD, buy one. The more battles you have the more time you'll spend loading. I've been enjoying 5 second loads on my M.2.


TL;DR
In total the game becomes slow and deliberate compared to its predecessors, which largely devolved into paint-by-numbers spamfests. Controlled growth is key, and many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead. If you're playing Total War with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in Warhammer, but hardcore strategists will love this game.",1559244338,1559244338,True,0.523809552192688,True,False,False,1156,en

Overall, I am very impressed with the game as a whole. A lot of the systems in previous Total War titles are present and have been vastly improved upon. While there are some thing that could use improvement (more on this later), the core systems that the game functions around are solid and all the main issues can be easily fixed with mods (which will come at some point down the line, just like all the previous Total War games).

Diplomacy is actually a thing now, which is nice. There are still some flaws with it, but it's vastly improved from previous Total Wars. There's a ton of new options, like being able to buy/sell/trade provinces, or absorbing other factions through alliance/marriage. You don't need to conquer the map simply by conquest alone (though admittedly it's still the easiest option). 

My biggest issue with diplomacy has to be the vassal system. Once a faction becomes a vassal you are severely limited in what diplomatic options you can take with them. And it is very hard (i.e. impossible) to un-vassalize them aside from eradicating their master faction. Add to the fact that the AI seems to have very little issue with vassalizing other AIs, and a game can quickly snowball out of control once one AI faction starts vassalizing a bunch of others. There needs to be more diplomatic options for dealing with vassals, and specifically one for freeing them from their master.

The campaign map feels a lot more open than previous Total Wars. There are very few chokepoints and natural barriers. Diplomacy is key for anchoring one side of your borders against an ally so you can expand on the other. It is very easy to be invaded and very hard to sit back and defend. On the flip side, it is very easy to invade enemies and take/raze their undefended settlements. You definitely need to play a more aggressive style as compared to previous Total Wars.

Economy in this game is really hard and really slow. Very few buildings actually generate income. And to upgrade those buildings you need specific research that takes a long time to complete. And you can't even build those buildings until you upgrade your cities first for the building slots, but that requires a lot of food. So first you need to find/build food, then you need to upgrade your city, and then finally you can build your economy buildings. But one economy building by itself doesn't generate a lot of wealth, you need to stack it with other buildings to boost its output. But that requires bigger cities, which require more food.... So yea, it's very had to get your economy up and running.

Which means for most of the early game your gold will be from winning battles and sacking cities. You get some amount of gold every time you win a battle, plus the option to ransom captive for even more. Sacking enemy settlements rewards a ton of gold, plus you can usually get a faction to pay you some gold for a peace treaty after you defeat a lot of their armies. This is another reason why it's good to be aggressive in the early game, it is the best way to make money. 

My biggest problem with the city/building system is that half the buildings are complete and utter trash and just never worth building. For example, the Tax Collection building generates very little income compared to other options and applies a MASSIVE public order penalty. And there's no reason to ever build a Grain Silo instead of a Military Outpost or Confusian Temple. But these are things that can be rebalanced in mods.

The battle system feels really, really slow compared to previous Total Wars. It takes a long time for units to move anywhere. Units take and deal damage very slowly, and it can take several minutes for a fight to end, that in previous Total Wars would take 30s. I guess they slowed down the combat so that people would have more time to zoom the camera around and look at the battlefield. I'm not really into that but I get it. It's not really an issue though since I can just play all the battles on 2x speed and then it feels similar to the other Total Wars.

My biggest issue with the battle system is that unit formations aren't always available. For example, Loose Formation or Wedge Formation or Spear Wall aren't usable unless you have specific traits/items on your generals. In the early game it won't be too much of an issue since you'll be playing with a few, high-level generals. But later in the game those will die off either in battle or from old age and you'll have too many generals to keep track of who has what bonuses. It really removes a lot of the tactical element with not have those formations available in battle. The first mod I get will be something that makes all the formations available at all times.

And finally the general/family system. I like it, it's not nearly as complicated/convoluted as Rome 2 and Attila but also has a bit more depth than Shogun 2. You don't have to worry about politics within your own faction, just make sure your generals are satisfied and you're good to go. You even have a list view for all your generals! No more hunting through a family tree of copy/pasta portraits and similar names just trying to find the one guy with low loyalty. 

Overall, I'd say this is the best Total War game I have played to date. Though, to be fair I did skip Warhammer and Thrones of Brittannia. But I do have over 1100 hours in Shogun 2 and about 250 each in Rome 2 and Attila so I am invested in the franchise.

3K has two core mechanics which change the way the game feels:

Romance - Very much like how the books and the games like Dynasty Warriors shows - Individual General units which can tear apart entire retinues single handedly, but are vulnerable to capture by your opponents if they fall in battle. You can change the course of history by never letting Diao Chan get close to Lu Bu.
Records - Honouring a more realistic approach where Generals have bodyguard units and have a more 'support' feel in battle, and historic events happen.

The campaign is deep, layered, strategically rewarding and realistic (relatively speaking). Characters are treated like actual individuals and not just a group of numbers. Complex diplomatic deals are possible. It really feels like governing a realm, with ministers and administrators, sending people out on a host of assignments, managing taxes and population and such. You must worry about your military supplies and reserves, and choose your approach carefully right up to the end of the campaign. Factions feel distinct despite the homogeneity of the setting. It is a massive improvement over previous TW titles. 

A special nod to the new recruitment system. It is historically accurate in the context of 3K and rewarding from a gameplay perspective. It makes sense that only an expert in shock warfare would be able to recruit and train elite shock cavalry, that a master of defense gets access to elite spear infantry, and so on. It also adds a sense of structure / chain of command to battles, which is long overdue in Total War and other strategy games. It perfectly simulates the hereditary / semi-feudal aspect of 3K armies that was one of the main reasons of the wars of the Three Kingdoms, where soldiers are strictly loyal to their local leaders over kings or emperors.

The diplomacy system has improved by leaps and bounds. Tradeable territories and marriage deals are back after a long absence. Food has been added as a valuable tradeable resource. Factions have a whole lot of new ways to interact, with confederations, alliances, vassals, confederations, threats, coercion and annexations. The AI is generally competent at handling itself at a strategic level.

Battles have not improved as much but are still a lot better than Warhammer. Battle pacing is good. Battles are visually stunning with all those flowing banners and massive army sizes. Cavalry charges are destructive. Formations are back and expanded. Massive multi-layered sieges are back. Tactically the game is pretty similar to Rome 2 / Med 2, with the addition of duels and chain of command.

The UI is exceptionally beautiful and well-rounded for such a complex multi-layered game. Audio-visuals are stellar as expected from a Total War game. The environments are especially beautiful and varied. The campaign map looks like it is painted by hand. What is surprising given all that is how smoothly it runs. 

And it is pretty stable. Zero crashes or major bugs in 24 hours for me. There are some minor oversights and balancing issues that need to be sorted out via patches, as with any new release of such scale, with so many new features. But overall it is superbly polished.

My only major complaint would be that it is extremely difficult and luck-based to recruit the unique legendary generals in the game. In my first Cao Cao campaign I did not get any of the legendary Cao Wei generals other than the Xiahou Cousins. And that some of the new mechanics like espionage and character relations are a bit barebones and would have to be expanded.

And perhaps some exotic units like chariots and elephants can be introduced via DLCs to spice things up on the long run.

so the pros and cons so far;

PRO:
1. True to the ROTK lore for the most part, the heroes are there, the characters are there, the scenarios and specific campaigns seem so far to stay mostly true to the story\history.
2. Hero and generals (Characters) is there. CA did an wonderful job of implementing them as significant variables on the battlefield that can change the tide of a battle. I believe this is something hard to do without making the battle too OP for the player or the AI. but CA got it pretty damn close..
3. Progression systems are great, the fact your main characters level up and get new skills and can equip various items and gear is fantastic. Duels are awesome. Of course WHTW did this too, but it was really important they did this right in this game, and they did imo.
4. Well done city and base developement. i mean i dont know, it could be deeper i guess but doesn't bother me.
5. Military Units are cool and special units for legendary generals is great.
6. There is some diplomacy, that's cool but could be better.
7. Graphics are pretty good, it seems the same engine as WH total war, so good enough.
8. Love that you can change audio for voice actors to Mandarin, adds to the immersion.
9. More than one style of playing game (historical or fictional) which is a staple of the ROTK games that have come before. I think was a great design decision by CA. You guys really did your Homework, thank you.

Cons so far:
1. Deeper character dialogue between family members, friends, rivals and adversaries would have been cool (To be fair i base this off of years playing the KOEI ROTK games so im just used to it).
2. A deeper system of diplomacy would have been great. Sure its ok, but it is rather basic (Again, used to KOEI ROTK).
3. Can be a little confusing in terms of how and when you can build certain structures and recruit certain army units.
4. I would have liked to have seen the option to create your own Ruler, Lords, family, factions etc. In a fictional Campaign scenario (YEt again lol, used to KOEI ROTK games allowing you to do this).


None of the cons make this game not worth $60.00 it is definitely worth that based on the depth and great gameplay the game has provided me so far. I will update my review once i get more hours in, but as of now i want to say;
 Thank you Creative Assembly and SEGA, for having the deep passion that you do for making great freaking games. Especially in this live service lootbox greedy publisher reality we live in these days. Thank you.",1559182940,1559192592,True,0.0,True,False,False,511,en

Good:
-	Diplomacy
-	Spy network
-	Character leveling
-	Battles. (The fact that you can see soldiers makes this RTK better than KOEI versions. Unfortunately, I seem to be mostly delegating battles. Maybe because the battle themselves are not interesting enough …)
Bad:
-	Bugs (minor but annoying). 
o	Diplomacy dialog offers option to ignore war request, yet war is still triggered?
o	AI moves army instead of defending its city when my army is of same strength
o	Character defects to enemy, but is still Administrator in my army???
-      Characters start to hate each other for no reason its seem. For example, Everybody starts to hate Sun Ce (even Sun Quan) or Xiahou Dun suddenly started to hate Cao Cao.. really ??? 
-	Cost of supporting cities and lack of funds for army. I have 1/3 of china with at least half my cities upgraded and I am only making 4K?
-	Micromanagement of cities (Should have delegated governors like KOEI RTK)
-	Battles are missing traps (fire, boulders, etc.) like the KOEI RTK (Maybe this would help make battles a bit more interesting.)
-	Missing diplomacy cutscenes like KOEI RTK. Would of like to have seen my diplomat enter the city and meet the ruler and advisors of my enemy.
-	Having to always hover to see info (weapons, tech, building) is kind of annoying. UI/UX could have been a bit better.
-	Character comparison and strengths/weaknesses are hard to see in important recruitment and assignment screens. KOEI did it better with 0 to 100 levels for stats.

Fell in love with the game with the original Shogun and have played every total war ever since as any passionate fan would do. I have truly enjoyed every Total war that has come out since, but 3K just feels different to me.  

This is very hard for me to say, but this game is just boring. It feels like it's incomplete. Disappointing to say the least, since I waited a hella long time for 3K to come out.

Why do I say this? Here's a brief list:
- It feels like the devs spent waaaay too much time on the character system, which isn't all that exciting and is mostly repetitive or irrelevant to the progress of the campaign.

- EVERY. SINGLE. BATTLE. FEELS. THE. SAME. This is mostly because of the units, which are more or less  all the same or as useful as hillmen in ROME II.

-Battle animations are boring and combat seems unrealistic at times.

-Battles involve ZERO strategy to win. It's a question of who can field the most troops.

Overall, I would say I recommend the game to Total war Fans only, but not to individuals who feel indifferent towards the series.

They brought back the old Shogun 2 mechanics for cities and their villages, but also brought along the province system from the other titles.

On top of that, its battle system in Romance mode is akin to Warhammer style gameplay, which just makes this game basically have a ""Dynasty Warriors"" feel to it, with certain classes of heroes being more effective against others. 

Whats more impressive is that the campaign is fairly challenging! and I mean late game challenge. Total War games tend to be hard at the start but once you've established yourself its basically painting the map at your leisure...Not so in this campaign. It brings back ""Realm Divide"" from Shogun 2 but more polished for China. So have fun fighting off the remaining factions who arent already under your control.

Since Rome 2, Total War has struggled to find it's footing in it's historical titles. Attila had a lukewarm reception and Thrones of Britannia used the same engine while not providing a whole lot of new content aside from a change in factions and a few tweaks to gameplay. Over the years, Attila and Rome 2 have both received numerous post-launch updates, changing many of the ways of how the game was originally played, and for the better. 

The other big thing to happen to Total war in recent years was Warhammer. The Fantasy based Total War game breathed new light into the franchise and introduced some of the the most ambitious gameplay changes to the series. While being well received critically and by players, some Total War fans were worried that this new title focusing on big heroes, magic and myth would overshadow the historical titles in the future.

Which brings us to Three Kingdoms, the Romance of The Three Kingdoms is a sprawling novel focusing on the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280. The novel features many outstanding characters and draws from the history of China to tell a story about the unification of China and the grand people behind it all.  All this combines to give us a historical title with aspects of myth and fantasy woven into it.

Total War: Three Kingdoms combines all the lessons learned from previous Total War games and combines them into one it's best historical titles in a long time. Offering two distinct ways to play the game:

- Romance Mode: A focus on the larger than life characters, big heroes that can change the tides of battle, engage in duels and are an army of one. Battles are usually faster, with a bigger focus on using your characters abilities.

- Records Mode: A focus on tactics and the traditional Total War experience. Characters are accompanied by a unit of bodyguards and don't wield the strength as they do in Romance mode. Battles are typically slower, where positioning and pacing is more important.

Each play mode has it's own distinct feel, but given this game's importance in characters, I have opted to play the game initially in Romance mode. 

As for the game itself, it is laser focused on depicting it's source material and setting, with lavish colours, sweeping landscapes and a suitable soundtrack and audio. The added touch of Chinese language is nice as well, and probably appreciated by anyone playing in China as well. 

Each faction has a host of characters and rulers that all have different goals and ambitions in unifying China. From scholars and healers to veterans and warlords. Keeping all these archetypes happy within your kingdom is of grater importance in this title than many previous titles as well. All your characters have likes and dislikes, and personality traits that will effect their standing with your leader as well as the other characters of your court. If relationships sour too far,you may be looking at a potential new enemy on the battlefield. Not only will the character leave your service, he may take his armies with him. 

Additionally, all your characters have a skill tree and inventory to invest in as well. As you fight and administer your regions, they will gain experience and items that further increase their strengths as well as their dedication to you and your cause. The emphasis on characters, relations and diplomacy actually feel like a fundamental part of the game now as opposed to it feeling optional or a non-important in previous titles.

New features aside, game has had one of the smoothest launches of any Total War title, and appears to be better optimized than the Warhammer titles. The campaign is sprawling, but the game will keep doling out quests and missions for you to keep you focused on smaller goals while trying to ""paint the map"" with the colour of your faction. Out of all the Total War games released over the years, Three Kingdoms is a landmark title that will probably appease older fans and appeal to newer fans as well.

Is it an amazing experience? Definitely.

Total War: Three Kingdoms is a massive game, with tons of new and returning features that make it stand apart as an excellent strategy game. The setting is vibrant and alive, and the fact that Creative Assembly decided to base this game so heavily on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms means that there is an established mythos of characters and events that lends an unparalelled  sense of depth to the game.

3K works incredibly well as a bridge between the fantasy of Warhammer 1 & 2 and the authenticity of historical titles like Rome 2 and Shogun 2. The game is colorful and fantastical, full of unique characters and flavourful mechanics.
But it doesn't have to be! If you want it to, 3K can be a properly authentic historical title, with none of the fantastical elements of the Romance novel. Records mode removes the larger than life heroes and heroic duels of Romance mode, and changes the game into an experience reminiscent of previous historical titles. You can even change the color palette to be darker and grittier, with less of the vibrant colors that help build the fantastical flavour of the Romance mode.

This is the best Three Kingdoms game on the market and it only has potential to get better with more updates and DLC.

The biggest improvement in this game is the diplomacy. No longer do you have to play a guessing game with the AI if they will even accept your offer but now you can see how resistance they have to the offer and haggle with a variety of options to get them to agree. Getting into coalition and alliance are actually pretty useful now. Vassal could use some fixing tho with defending got take a hit on your trust rating if you had a deal with the attacker. Sometimes you'll find out they want what you're offering so much, that they'll give you something for it. The character also all have relationship now, with people they like and hate. Some can even become oathsworn brother with even other or become a hated nemesis after many eccounter on the battlefield. Managing your empire also take a fair bit of thinking now. Having to balance which of the 3 income to focus on along with dealing with pubic order due to population. 

The politics of the court system is a bit bland tho. It's good you have to keep your generals happy or they'll leave but it's pretty easy to keep them happy with some court position. The court system could do with more update to make them more interesting and harder to manage beside just throwing random people into any random position. The mission the council could also use more variety. 

The battles are great fun with the improvement I can see is the environmental effect affecting battles like fighting in snow slows you down, sand tire you out faster. You can set the forest on fire and it'll damage the unit health and morale.

As much as I love the lore and replayability (over 600 hours currently) of Warhammer 2, the limited nature of diplomacy always bugged me. Even compared to games like Civ, Three Kingdoms has really upped the ante here, and this is hopefully a big step forward for other games, Total War or otherwise, to follow. There may still be some moments here or there where you feel some limitations, but until we're speaking into microphones and arguing with an AI Cao Cao, we'll probably be feeling those moments. That said, it feels so much better to have diplomacy with some real depth. 

Diplomacy aside, it's still the best Total War to date. The game stays interesting into the endgame and the AI faction's turn durations stay short. There's still a good amount of troop variation, obviously nothing compared to Warhammer, but the faction heroes fill that role amazingly, spicing things up and making the factions have real character. Speaking of which, I do get reminiscent of Dynasty Warrior games as the champions talk trash on the field, or as Lu Bu will take on regiment after regiment assisted only by Red Hare. Even with the generic champions, because of the layers of character design, they all have personalities and potentially rivals, friends, families, and loyalties, so they feel like more than the generic champions and generals of past Total War games.

Currently almost finished my campaign in Romance as Liu Bei, will probably try Yellow Turbans next because they seem to have a fair amount of interesting and unique mechanics, and I'm imagining I'll still be game for a third campaign afterwards. It's been to satisfying to play.

I took control of the surrounding commandries with food resources and sold the excess food to factions that were ""very poor"" in food but rich in coin in exchange for regular payments. It supplied me with the wealth needed to raise multiple armies [strike]of expensive units[/strike] and quite aggressively build/expand.

The game has a bit of a learning curve even for veterans of the franchise, and yet, it feels so rewarding. The battles takes the rock/paper/scissor unit tactics of Shogun 2 and mixes it with the combat involved generals of Warhammer. If you don't like the latter part (Romance mode), then you can play it like a classic Total War game (Records mode). 

Campaign wise, the new generals system has added a whole new layer of logistics to keep an eye on. Managing each general's equipment and satisfaction also gives a sense of attachment where losing one can represent a significant loss unlike previous Total War titles where generals felt easily replaced. For newcomers, the system and UI can be quite intricate and seem overwhelming, but once you get it down, it feels like playing a tabletop game. 

The environment is beautiful on all seasons. The new battle maps system works where you can click anywhere on the map to create a battle map based on that location on the campaign map. 

Overall this is my favorite Total War game thus far. Took me a while, but I managed to (mostly) finish my first campaign at this point.

First off i have to say i can only enjoy a game when i fully understand it and when i know everything there is to know. And with three kingdoms this is one of the difficulties that arises. There is so much to learn that learning all of it without watching tutorials and playthroughs and pressing F1 every 5 minutes is simply impossible. At the time of writing this review all of my hours played (a mere eight) have all been just straight up learning how to play and switching between characters/campains to see why i need a blue building instead of a green one.

Besides having to go through the learning process (which never really ends) you have to constantly be aware of everything and think about more than three things at a time before making a decision, the game is really heavy on thinking before you act. Maybe im just all-round describing a strategy game here in general, but it really feels like the thought process and mind game in total war three kingdom plays a much much bigger role than it has before (again, i only played rome 1&2).

At this moment you are probably waiting for the part where i say why i still think it is a great game and deserves a thumbs up, but then you would be wrong because i already have. The thing i like MOST about 3kingdoms is that you have to think about every little detail if you want to win. This makes it so much more rewarding to win a battle or a campaign even, than in Rome 1&2 where if wanted to be sure you were going to win, you'd just spam out two full armies with legionaries. 

Behind this story of improvement is a rework/improvement of almost every mechanic in the game and it is great. It is just good. Everything works. If something is wrong with the game, it's probably your pc and not the game.

I was really starting to get burnt out on Total War before I tried three kingdoms. It was always the same thing, the same exact strategies, just a constant steamroll. In 3K you have so many more options on how to conquer the map, thanks to the really good diplomacy system this time around. 

You wanna play for an economic victory? Do it. starve the enemy and feed them the solution, or amass your funds and use pure wealth to buy-out everyone smaller than you. 

Still like war-mongering? Do it. Rule through violence, or fear. Once you become powerful enough you can issue ultimatums to weaker nations, essentially forcing them to give in to your demands or else war will be declared. The more powerful you are, the better chance they'll submit.

Or you can be deceptive and manipulate everyone else into killing eachother. one faction in particular has the ability to start proxy wars and make other nations fight eachother without having to get dirty themselves.

imo, this game could be considered as one of the best title in the franchise.

pros:
- Deeper, more exciting diplomatic system with lots of tools you can use and AI works quite good with it (compared to previous titles where AI can declare war, break alliances and didn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥in alliance)

- Good optimization compared to other titles

- Better ui overal with color code implemented to things like unit, buildings, etc making you able to better understand what compliment what. 

- Deeper emphasize on characters (especially on romance mode)

- oh and ambush battle is actually tense and escaping is actually an option now, not just like regular battle

cons:
- no sync animation (or only rare) and combat happen too fast or arcadey unlike in previous titles (even tho tbh this grow on me eventually and now i dont really mind it)

- Ai still use cheat to help them sadly, even tho AI isn't that bad imo (see my later point)

neutral?
- Graphics as you can see is a bit different compared to previous historical title. it got some style to it

- New mechanics or micromanagement you can do to optimize your commandery/settlement in different ways. i don't really care or mind this too much tbh so you can ignore it or do it if you like micromanage everything

- AI in this title has some improvement compared to previous recent titles. In land battle, they will wait for reinforcement if it's an option. AI will now actually attack and come for you if they are the one who did that on the map and will defend if you are the one attacking, even tho in land battle they could also move up if they aren't greatly outnumbered. They use their cav to flank us so thats good too. In romance, they are smart enough to deny duel where the odds really against them.

It took all the good elements from the previous titles and put them together. Political / Diplomatic stuff is well made and the battles are great to look at. 
The game itself has two ""modes"", Records and Romance:

In Records mode, your general apparently (have not tried it yet, will explain why) has bodyguards and is regular in terms of strength, like most Total War games.

Romance version is different, because the general does not have any bodyguards, is a single unit but mainly is very powerful, capable of cutting down hundreds of enemies (although this depends on the type of general / hero and enemies they are fighting). Furthermore, romance version has duels for heroes / generals, so they fight between each other and the victor receives all kinds of bonuses (e. g. moral for army). Mainly, it helps locking down hero / general that would otherwise mop down a lot of your troops. This ""mode"" is way too much fun for me to even try the Records one. It's just like Dynasty Warriors, except better!

I will now list pros and cons of this game...

Pros:
+ Gameplay both on the battlefield and outside, large scale battles
+ Unique generals with their own traits, personalities, armour, voices, faces and abilities
+ Diplomatic management and management of your cities and your country
+ Sun Ren
+ Graphics
+ Pursuing Lü Bu
+ AI personality (although not always)
+ Difficulty (this can be either pros or cons, up to you)

Cons:
- There are only handful of unique generals (around 3 per faction), non-unique generals are generic with similar faces
- Yuan Shao and his endless vassals (if he gets out of hand)
- AI personality (although not always)
- System requirements (people with older computers or laptops might be unable to play this game at its fullest)
- Price (60 EUR is quite a bit)

Overall, I highly recommend this game. If you are not afraid of spending quite a bit of money, buy the game, otherwise wait for the game to be on sale (ETA 1 year). Also, I have heard and read rumours that the game should be getting more DLCs than just the Yellow Turban DLC... which is something to look forward to for sure.",1559110935,1559202001,True,0.5916488766670227,True,False,False,393,en

Like when you reach max level in an MMO and realize you have yet to experience the end game? That is this game about 60% of the time. This game is deep and expansive, which means you will likely get lost in the minutia of things more often than naught. 

It's overwhelming at times and overall it shouldn't be your first total war game. To make things worse, the backdrop is a very specific time period drenched with characters. The campaign almost requires you to research the people and their histories to understand how they play in the campaign. It's tough to jump right in, and overall Wahammer 2 (or even 1) might just be the total war for those who want an easier hill to climb.

That being said, if you decide to get this game you will absolutely be satisfied after a good 5 hours of campaign. At that point I was beginning to feel like a skillful leader and even emperor. I was carefully picking my administers and placing people of my court on local assignments just to barely squeeze enough money out of my peasantry based economy to hire 2 more units of missile archers. At one point my court contained my wife, son, second son, and 2 other dudes who weren't happy with the way I was running things. Needless to say I chose my second son because I gave my wife an assignment at a local town , my first son his own army, and the two other dudes a dog statue and a tough looking carpenter follower to keep them happy. 

It's these kinds of stories that you can tell when you play this game, and that's not even talking about the RTS battles.

Essentially, this game is great but overall hard to get into. If you do your due diligence then you can tell amazing stories that might actually be as epic as the actual Romance of the Three Kingdoms.",1559110428,1559110428,True,0.0,True,False,False,347,en

It seems that this time they actually replaced monkeys with real people who can code and even hired one or two testers because there are less bugs than you'd expect from a total war game and a game in general in 2019. Apart from having to run it in a windowed mode which fixed lags on the campaign map - i didn't encounter any crashes or issues so far.

The UI looks and feels like they played Paradox games and got inspired, map looks beautiful, music is fine, performance even on 970 GTX is tolerable, turns don't take forever, AI doesn't clump a billion armies in one spot and in fact uses diplomacy often and with purpose. 

The setting might be unusual but overall the game feels well rounded, deep enough and ""finished"" (unlike a lot of other games in recent years). They even added character interactions and voice overs, flavor events, dynasties, artifacts and rpg mode for battles where your characters mow down enemies just like in dynasty warriors.  

All of this begs the question: If you can actually release fun, stable and creative games out of the box, then why didn't you do it with Napoleon, Atilla, Shogun, Rome 2 and other bug ridden dlc-galore crash grabs before? Who or what was stopping you?

I found myself bored each play through - so much so that I often left the game on for hours taking breaks to watch television or do chores around the house.  Here is a list of what I felt they improved on for those that already have played total war games:

1. Diplomacy is better than previous installments.  Usually they keep this as a hollow mechanic, but this time it feels like they are getting somewhere.
2. The technology tree is very interesting and I feel is a step up from the more recent games. 
3. The spy system, once you understand what is going on, is more in depth than I initially realized.  I was very pleased to see they take a chance with more realistic spy system.
4. I really enjoy duels

Now onto the bad:
1. AI is a hot mess, typical of their game.  This is something they need to eventually fix, but I doubt they will until the cash cow goes dry.
2. Factions all are too similar.  This is more apparent after playing a game of such diversity like the warhammer total war series.
3. AI cheating is too obvious.  You constantly see AI with no food and gold that they can't possibly have made, but they are going around doing the same stuff as you.  This will become an issue once players reach a few hundred hours and realize how hollow the game really is.
4. 'Follow the story' is often too difficult, and when you do there is little to gain by it.  Going through 5 enemies to destroy one enemy because your faction did that in real life doesn't show the truth of how the world worked at that time, and they should have just done the similar instanced battle system they were doing.
5. The map is often hectic and confusing, and (at least I did) you have have to often go into the diplomacy screen just to figure out what is going on.  It eventually gets annoying.
6.  Battle maps suck still, as they put little to no effort in making maps.  This is a ongoing problem now for the series, and it is ridiculous that we have to wait on modders to get real battle maps.  

These are not complete lists, but they are samples of my opinion of the game.  I recommend this game to the people that buy each total war game and dedicate hundreds of hours into each game.  I do not recommend this game to new players to the total war series or more casual total war players.   It is not a bad game, but there are better titles that have had more work than this game by this company.

This game also has 2 types of modes for you to play in, one being Hero based (Romance Mode) where your generals can take on whole armies like they were Tyrion or Malaketh in Warhammer 2 or a realistic mode (Records) where your Generals are surrounded by body guards in a unit and they aren't as over exaggerated in strength.

I also love how in Battle, when you select a unit, you can hear the general speak and then his army responds in unity and if you select the whole army, you can hear all of them shout in unity.

The simplified economic system and change to general only commanded armies were difficult changes for me. I enjoyed the Total Warhammer series for the fantasy aspect and the tweaks they made, but that series also suffered from the same issues. Now with Three Kingdoms they seemed to have significantly improved and balanced these systems pretty well. The changes are definitely something to get used to. I was pretty upset at first because it's quite a lot to take in. Don't be so hasty to cast judgement and want  a refund though. Play it through until you get a good understanding of how the new systems play together. The way they implement the family, diplomacy, economy, and espionage are awesome. It's hard to find good hero's for traits that keep them satisfied with lower court positions. So keep that in mind. 

•Armies have improved in that the heroes are just captain units that can command a retinue of up to six other units. Each Army can consist of up to 6 other units. These units should match their heroes style, which is color coded for different character values, personalities, and starting skills. 

•Diplomacy is the best that it has ever been. It just makes sense. Having Cao Cao helps significantly with his skills too because he can use his passive credibility points to sway relations or instigate wars.

•Economy is back to a complex system of different buildings, government reforms, and the characters you use in government and court appointments like commandery assignments and administrative positions. It's heavily based on population growth and planning. I'm still on my first run and I built too many farms at first. I didn't feel like demolishing them so I started selling the excess to other factions that were poor, very poor, or negative on food in the diplomacy menu. 
With trade restricted from conflict and borders, this became an excellent source of income for 10 turns at a time. 

•Reforms come every 5 turns and allow you to advance your skills and bonuses. These are also how you unlock new troops. Most of the reforms require you to build a certain low level building to start the branch. You can build them and then convert them, or demolish them to rebuild a different type as a work around if you don't have the building space but want to unlock that branch of ""technology"". I had to do this with the county school to unlock the underground network. Which is the espionage system.

•The Underground Network is the replacement for agents, subterfuge, and sabotage. You assign specific heroes from your pool of court nobles or new recruits to embed themselves in another factions army. It can be annoying at first because there's no instant gratification of having an agent open the gates or stop and army dead in their tracks. But it does add an entire layer of enjoyable play carefully planning your tactics. Your character will try to enlist themselves in the other faction. If they succeed, then they'll begin building cover points and underground network points specific to them and that faction. These numbers can be boosted by using the two skills in the first menu. It's a difficult change, but very enjoyable once you understand it. (there is one issue with not being able to recall your character at the time of this review. You have to use larceny or a military revolt to recover your hero. That is unless they get caught.)

I think this is the best Total War to date in my opinion. The only people I would say to stay away are the ones who want a more realistic approach. Some people are calling it dynasty warriors because the heroes can be overpowered against non-hero units in battle.

Good: 
          +Large combat 
          +Good balance with those Generals and units
          +Internal affairs has changed to be an important element for game. Spy not just a character and go around the map to looking for target but hide in the enemy army or territory and gather information for you.
          +Total Units for an army is increase to 21 (3 Generals , each can recruit 6 units ). 
          +Five type of Generals, each type has own  advantage and disadvantage
Bad:
          -Not include all of famous Generals in game, but we can count on steam workshop.
          -Not include sea battle system
          -Historical events are less 
          -Special Units are not ""Special""(Only the name is different for those ""Special"" units)
          -Siege are too simple, tell me why CA you only allow us to build Battering ram but where is Escalade??

Nope.

This game shines above the rest of the series.  Performance is good, for once, but that improvement pales next to the engaging texture of the core game loop:  build, bargain, recruit, fight.  Why is it so different this time?  That's the same loop as ever. I feel like the changes from title to title in this series are not drastic - the developers rightly worry about upsetting their huge core fan group - but rather are incremental and I can't quite put my finger on what changes put this over the edge from 'playable' to 'fantastic fun' for me.  I think one thing is that the challenge stays challenging as you progress into the late game, which has always been a problem, but that's not the whole story.  I think the way the characters, factions, and provinces develop is also right in the sweet spot - but much much more importantly, the progression, goals, and actions of your enemies are just more realistic.  AI in combat is still listless and predictable (maybe next time Creative Assemblies) but even auto-resolving the majority of combat gives you a fun campaign.  Sorry, I can't quite put my finger on why, but I feel like this is the Total War game I've been hoping for since Empire.

All in all this game just feels like what it is: the culmination of play improvements that TOB almost, but not quite, reached.

My favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series.  I decided to give three kingdoms a try, and now I don't think I can ever go back.  It is so good, it makes every previous TW seem archaic.  Specifically, diplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much.  The choices you make affect so much more with coalitions, alliances, and vassals.  There is a lot more character development, to the point that you care so much about your council members, family members, and allies.  These individuals become intertwined, forcing you to really think about each negotiation.  Indeed, if you lose a general you care about, your other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationship.

Another impressive feat is performance.  Aside from a weird UI issue on the campaign map side, battles play absolutely beautiful.  I have engaged large battles as often as I can to really push my computers limit (i7 7700k, 16GB Ram, 1080 Duke video card) and I rarely get a noticable drop.  

As a side note, the music is awesome.  Whether it's when a battle is about to commence or during the battle itself, the fanfare really draws you in.

three kingdoms has not just set a standard for the TW series; it's set a standard for strategy games.  You can tell how much work went in to this game and how much attention to detail there is.  It is truly an impressive experience, and I can't recommend it enough.",1559072890,1559072890,True,0.9280188083648682,True,False,False,281,en

a total war game in ancient China WOW.

so far has completed a campaign playing as Yuan Shao.

+ gorgeous campaign map
+ building mechanism
+ court & administration
+ character interface (5 types of generals, ancillary & skill tree)
+ diplomacy option
+ reform / tech tree
+ various type of settlements (although I prefer the concept in Rome 2 city -> province, rather than county -> commandery)
+ Mid game / after reach King title
+ new spy mechanism 

never thought that a campaign in Total War game could be this exciting.
not many strategy games can be my favorites, but this one on the first day of release has become my favorite. Thank you for making an amazing game


now, can Creative Assembly grant our next request?

* Spring & Autumn DLC
* Warring States DLC

Battles are pretty similar to past historical Total War entries, with the exception of hero general units (available in Romance mode - generals aren't superhuman in the Records mode).

Most of the changes come from the overhauled diplomacy system (nice!) and general tweaks to the campaign. Diplomacy was very limited in past Total War games, so the ability to effectively barter with other factions adds a lot of possibilities to the state of your map.

My only complaint is that it's easy to get lost in the different building chains you can go down - there's a lot to keep track of for each location, because their income depends largely on what unique resources they have, if at all.

As a middle age Chinese player The Romance of The Three Kingdoms is still my favorite novel. I read it first time when I was about 12, although I did not understand it very well because it was written in medieval age Chinese. After that I have read it over hundred times, once and once again, every time I could find something new in this only 700,000 Chinese words book. 

When I was young, my hero was Cao Cao because he is a typical man lived with his true desire. He almost grabbed anyone or anything he loved, killed everyone he hated. But when I grew up, I have found out that Liu Bei is the true hero though Cao Cao is still the charming one. Liu Bei started from almost nothing just for his ideal, fought and failed, failed then fought, He never stop the struggle until he died at the age 62. and the most famous word from him is 勿以善小而不为，勿以恶小而为之。 ""Do anything good even it is small, Avoid any evilness even it is minor.""

Also there is another character I loved and I am still loving, ZhuGe Liang, the famous Mr.Kong Ming (Old time Chinese gentlemen always had 2 names and more callsigns, for family, for official, for writing a letter, etc. imagine that). He was the mentor of me for raising my personalty. He taught me anything about loyalty, wisdom, and fighting a war you can not win but you have to fight because it is your promise. Even better, what he had done basically are true history, not Jon Snow stuff. I guess that is the reason when I went to his temple in Chengdu, SiChuan, I could not hold my tears; especially when I read his famous announcement before his crusading just at the right place with my own eyes. 臣鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已；至于成败利钝，非臣之明所能逆睹也。""I will die fight with all my strength, even I do not know if I could win."" How powerful is his personality! 

What I want to say? HERO, the whole history of the Three Kingdoms could be summarized by these 2 words (In Chinese, Hero = 英雄，2 words). When all of the heroes fell down, the Three Kingdoms period ended. The history of the Three Kingdoms is just like a unbelievable meteor shower, all stars shined and fell, the sky became to dark. And this is also the theme of the novel (So it is very hard to read it till the end, you will feel quite lost after you finishing the final page). 

I hardly see any hero in this game, what I could see is bunch of random female peasants (since they are in some kind of peasant clothes) with weird Chinese name fighting each other. Very weird 5 elements concept (it is nothing related the tradition Chinese concept except the names) just made the system unnecessarily complicated. They did not even make a proper UI size for 3440 x 1440, the font size is way too small and could kill my eyes.

Being a fair person, I could see they have made some effort for the game. E.G. they made some lines based on the original novel or some poetry in that time, but still with too much flaw. They mixed some ancient performance with modern Chinese, which are also very weird. Some actors read the lines way too hard, sound they are from North Korea, not ancient China.

I believe this game still has much potential, but also with much problems need to be resolved. At this point, I could not recommend it, because it is too weird.",1559064741,1561666063,False,0.38209354877471924,True,False,False,614,en

second i think AI don't invest to mutch gold in armies or building ( i say that because i see warlords whit only one or two generals and a lvl 2 settlement from turn 1 till 40 and 8 k gold in treasure
anyway !!! for the firsth week comparet with rome 2 attila ( i wont insult this game puting thrones of britain in his rewiew) is very good !

Ai is preety good despite forced march and thei lack of economic conception

- More units.

CA have really outdone themselves with this game, from launch it's ran smoothly for me with no problems at all, playing on max settings I never seem to dip below 70 FPS, even during intense battles. The A.I (for the most part) seems decent, although they do appear to be able to spawn multiple armies out of nowhere even when they've had their economy badly damaged. I've not encountered a single bug in nearly 30 hours of game-play which for a total war game on launch is extremely impressive, although I have heard of some bugs from others (and some which have been patched as of this review). The game can sometimes be overwhelming towards the end with the amount of enemies you have to fight at once, but I thought the challenge really added to the game more than it took away. 
I seriously recommend this game to total war fans, and newer players alike since it's really easy to get in to, but with enough new material for older fans to enjoy.

Yeah, definitely not referring to the crashing issues.

What a shit show. 

Refusing to invest in technology, we suffer the same engine for some 10 years now.

And its buggier than ever. Unit collisions suck, they are painful to watch. Whats up with cav units being slower than infantry even though they should be twice as fast even when not charging. STUTTERING in sieges (or just any large battle) coz SHIT CODING cant process the pathing, resulting in massive delays and input lag (not affecting fps), units getting stuck on corners or each other, the walls are poorly implemented, causing massive issues.
 Is there even AI in this game? Everything in this engine sucks and I hate it. Unit highlights, firing arcs, unit auras combined halving your fps? Great engine, 0 improvements since rome2. MINISCULE UNIT SIZES even though game cant handle a proper siege anyway.

The few scripts governing the unit behavior both campaign and battle wise are, per usual, easy to exploit and make for a very boring gameplay. 
So, 90% of legendary campaign time is spent wiping out AI stacks with 3 garrison units, over, and over, and over again. Coz' towers are THAT broken.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
Balance is completely out of whack. Morale debuff stacking routing whole armies before battle even starts? Trebuchets, one-shotting whole units with a direct hit (AI unit 'mosh pitting'
doesn't help here). Yellow turban generals passive AND active 40k heal? who tested that? HOW do you even LOSE a campaign battle? Noone noticed the spamable Vanguard special attack bug yet (romance only)? Cool coz it doesnt matter, AI ignores your retarded 1 general cycle charging cheese until it routs off the field anyway (romancy only). Siege AI doesn't even have a win condition! Generals are just roaming around getting picked off by towers or idling in the middle of nowhere going back and forth stuck in a loop, units helplessly trying to find a path in, doing laps around a city until they get wiped. One scripts breaks down a gate, second one should follow up with cav charge you might think? but not the case! Enemy mounted units just go all the way around, dismount, climb the wall and seek the closest tower to die under.

Everything feels so forced and unfinished, its like a school project. I can't fathom anyone playing the game with english voiceacting for more than a few hours.

Theres basically 2 factions in this game, Yellow Turbans and everyone else. All coallition forces, dong zhuo, governs, bandit waifu and rambo dude play exactly the same, their unique gimmicks do not matter in the slightest. Expansion is always the answer, AI cant keep up with how stupidly it deals with garrisons. You can still thrive and prosper with 90% corruption, no big deal.

CONFUSING diplomacy prompts, once u get used to them its too late as you have started skipping through entire diplomacy part of the game anyway, designers did a piss poor job there. The relationship tree is something straight out of a kindergarden as well. Absoutely useless as is the worlds characters pane.

My proposition has always been to get rid of the godawful campaign altogether coz engine sucks, UI sucks, AI sucks, you cant fix it or do not bother to fix it coz you sell millions of copies anyway. Main point of this game and its legacy should always be the MASSIVE realistic real time battles. Every other total war title goes in the opposite direction. Focus on the fucking battles that made the game popular in the first place. Suport multiplayer! Noone plays multiplayer? Thats because you give 0 fucks about it, and rather host clueless twitch thots further embarrassing the series in your greedy attempts to 'streamline the experience'. Total War: Arena was ruined by a poor cashgrab design, not lack of interest.

There's one faction that vassalizes the majority of the map 60 turns in and simply sends his minions to overwhelm you before things really get going.  It's so bad in this regard it makes you wonder if anyone played it before release.  A literal campaign killer.  In my last play through he had vassalized 11 other factions, five of which were sent to war with me and all by turn 65.  It would be comical if I hadn't wasted all that time on dud campaigns.  

I've missed the depth that previous historic titles had over the simplicity of Warhammer so I've really enjoyed the expanded diplomacy but there's too much emphasis on it.  It feels like Total Diplomacy and not Total War.  Every turn eight factions declare war, peace and vassals.  Everybody wants to offer you a bad deal, all the time, constantly, forever.  They'll need to overhaul it to strike a better balance.  Great to have the options, just dial it back a few notches.

In regards to the graphics, UI and art, CA always looks to cut cost and corners in whatever way they can.  They try to be sneaky about it by having it be themed but cheap.  Plain unit tiles and unacceptably bad building icons for Rome 2, still pictures for Warhammer that they slowly zoom in and out of in order to create a sense of life and Charlemagne's stained glass theme featuring prison tattoo quality artwork.  This is no different; it's misty water coloured treatment is nice but that's where it ends.  It's ultimately a washed out campaign map and cartoony battles, like they were trying to dumb it down for the mobile market.  This isn't some indie company that needs to stretch a threadbare budget.

I love Total War but CA always finds a way to disappoint.  Due to the campaign being broken I  obviously can't recommend it.  It'll be interesting to see if they release hotfixes like other companies or drag their feet for 3 months for minor patching like they have in recent memory.  I have no doubt it will improve over a few patches and more importantly once the workshop is up and running but I regret buying early.  Serves me right I guess.

Three Kingdoms does well at capturing the Total War fantasy of building your own empire through blood and diplomacy. Three Kingdoms adds a lot of new exciting mechanics that I myself have longed for having played multiple Total War titles. Its a great game for someone who wants a lot of action and for someone who likes a lot of customization. Having done a complete map conquest and completing another campaign, I know the game has a lot more in store with the many different factions that do well to make themselves unique. I know a Total War game is good when I can't wait for DLC to come out for it after having it out for less than a week. A few negatives would be a lot of bugs; the game has crashed a lot throughout my play. Also while I applaud the diplomacy and the new spy system, diplomacy is a bit cheesy with ancillaries being highly valued by the AI. Another thing I found was outrageous vassilization, top factions vassilzing other top factions with both factions seeming healthy. Also as Zheng Jiang, the late game tribute system seemed odd as I was getting up to 35k per turn by demanding tribute very easily from my rivals. Spying seems very cool, but with little to deal with defections and it not being as impactful, I think its average. Regardless of the bugs, I think the game does very well to capture the Total War fantasy. It reminds me of Shogun 2 but in China and a newer more expanded upon title.

EDIT: Redacting it to ""regretful buy game."" More below why I did that.

Generals who are not unique people all look the same. Literally the only difference between people of the same class is a bit of facial features, but even then there are very few. It doesn't help with when generals of the same class dress in the same color to boot, not even in their faction colors. I know it's to help distinguish classes... but come on, this isn't preschool, we can read. 

I know it is engine limitations... but they said that this engine would be built from the ground up. In a setting of battles between millions of people... why make an engine that can only support the same number of troops as Rome 1? Surely professional money making game developers can make it happen. 

Border gore. BORDER GORE. It's a small thing, but never would a person old control over 2 parts of china with little struggle when they are on opposite sides of the map. Especially during this time period.

They know about AI making vassals way too easily, but part of it is the insane boost the AI get. Instead of improving their AI, they just... give them more money. It's a lazy and stupid way of going about it and they know it. When you control a 3rd of China and can hardly afford to keep 3 and a half armies, while AI factions with one city and one farmland can crank out 2 full stack armies... it's really just sad. It's been a problem since Rome 2. Wasn't that released in 2012?

There are good things, but by now you have read them all. There are other problems but these are the main ones that come to mind. 

EDIT: Now that I have delved into late game, the money issue is just worse. I was having a blast, with the very often ""why the FUCK would you attack me? Oh right programming anti-player always works well in these games."" However... Lui Bei BOUGHT Sun Ce's throne. For like 13000. Plus around 3k per turn. I had to reload to see what money he had. It was really beautiful, to see the save I put about 10 hours in just crash around me. 

I held most of the north as Gongunsan. From Luo Yang to the whole northern province where Yuan Shao starts. And I could HARDLY afford 4 armies. Scratch that, I had 3 decent armies and 2 single general armies trying to hold off 2 alliance wars (by the way when you are in an alliance war and the forced declaring Kingdomship happens, you cannot leave alliance war. That may have led to Sun Ce's downfall of not being able to negotiate with most people like me.) 

Let me talk about that forced ""realm divide"" shit again. Nah, you can't hide it, it's a realm divide. Again. Attila was complained about a too easy late game so they just went back to what they know. Ah yeah... about what they already know...

They have not updated their AI since Rome 2, confirmed. Still avoiding the big powers and letting them just slaughter/buy your way out. Lovely. Why do they avoid truly updating the AI like no tomorrow? Why do I feel I am still fighting Rome 2 factions?

The revamped diplomatic system presents players to explore other play-styles beyond your typical full-stack armies hopping from one enemy province to the next. Coalitions are encouraged, if not always a necessity, and the introduction of multiple trade-able is a welcome addition to help mix things up from previous titles. Want to stockpile food to sell to the rest of China at an inflated price? You now can!

I didn't think I would enjoy Romance mode, as I wasn't a fan of Warhammer and it's powerful generals, magic, monsters etc. But I'm happy to say that I love it and the heroes/characters. Racking up several hundred kills with a general can be very rewarding but with a risk - they are not indestructible. I have lost a number of powerful and significant characters as I was too busy micro-managing cavalry elsewhere on the map. Read beware: if you're not careful, you characters will die.

I suppose that is a bit of a statement about the era. A tumultuous time where any slight mistake can have disastrous consequences and it is that raising of the stakes that makes the game so much more enjoyable and re-playable. I had no prior interest in the Ancient China but - as is the way with Total War games - I have now done bits of reading here and there to learn about the period and the main players involved. Fascinating stuff.

Ultimately, this is by far my favourite of the series to date. Shogun II sat atop that throne and I honestly was not expecting it to be usurped by 3K. I was wrong. The king is dead; long live the king.

This game kills it in all aspects! I absolutely love it!!

First character I chose to play.. Gonsun Zan.. hard difficulty. Yuan Shao was taking massive amounts of land.. myself, Kong Rong, and Liu Bei began a coalition.. destroyed most of Yuan Shaos army and executed him when he was captured. The only down side of the Coalition.. Liu Bei took half of his land while I took the other half. 

Liu Bei was extremely high friendship rating, labeled “best friends”. Almost +300 friendship.

I realized the only main threat I faced was Liu Bei.. for that reason, while Liu Bei was called to assist me in battle after a Yuan Tan army.. I left the coalition, surrounded Liu Bei with 3 armies.. and captured him, Guam Yu, and Zhang Fei. 

Broke my heart and I was labeled treacherous.. but I knew I had to take him out or the 3 would later prove to be a massive pain. I executed all 3.. took their equipment, and gave it all to my best generals.

Then I mopped up most of his lands with ease, and taking out/executing Kong Rong!

          For the record I skipped both Warhammer titles. I also skipped thrones of Brithania when i read about ridiculous changes implemeted to game. 
           I'm not sure what to begin with. I'll go with expectations - during first hours of gameplay I can say ALL my expectations were fullfilled and lots more. This game contains the best features from every TW title. First of all the game is ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Im not talking about graphics only - I'm talking about interface, music characters, charts. I think it's more beautiful than Shogun 2 which I absolutely loved. Then we have the gameplay. SI can be very smart and deceptive (I had serious concerns when watching eary gameplays on YT). 
          Something i always missed in previous total wars: storytelling, or story-like features. I remember adding mods to Shogun 2 so generals can get more points in order to make them more individual and interesting. In this game generals are not only summary of their stats, they are characters and they have big impact on your gaming style and they make great background for the story. Don't get me wrong - it's not general centered, its just that they added many factors into battlefield and campagin map. When you start campaign you can choose generals to be half-god single characters on battlefield or classic with guard (I went with the second option).  You can really feel you are running dynasty and you can somehow start getting attached to the characters. They are very well written, many of them are very characteristic, for example Liu Bei is ""virtous idealist"" while there are others described as ""drunken fighter"", ""warriors"" , ""scholars"", ""bandits"" and so on and on - it determines their skills, abilities and traits.  Game adds many very interesting events and missions and they are more creative than ""defeat army X"" or ""survive until following date"". There are other faction leaders that will give you various propositions so you really feel like you participate in global politics (not only war/peace/trade cases). Did I mention new, complex diplomacy system that is very interesting and it's very natural?
          Economy is also very well thought as well as technology tree - every mechanism  implemented in game could be historically justified. It gan get as complex as Attila but it's not that exhausting - you don't feel like you have to fight for every point of satisfaction, yet economy can become very ""grateful"" if handeled wisely.  Moreover, despite adding many factors to the game (prestige, supplies, complex diplomacy, intrigues, kind of story telling) nothing seems to be added just for the sake of it. 
             Two weeks ago when I was trying to figure out Uesugi in Shogun 2 for a third time I was thinking that this game had this exceptional balance in every aspect and I thought of shogun 2 as a best and most complete TW part ever (I also play Attila a lot but I prefer small - scale feeling). Guys I swear I've never been so excited for game that wanted to write review. I want to say big THANK YOU to Creative Assembly for one of the greatest gaming experiences in my life and I must say I never thought I'd get that excited about any game ever. 11/10 I'm probably gonna play this game for years and years.

It's been over a month.  The game is still unplayable beyond a couple turns.  Three major updates and it still crashes constantly.  Now they're trying to sell DLC instead of fixing the product that's already paid for.  This is the breaking point.  I'm giving up on Total War for a while.  Maybe I should wait until a title is out for a year, has gone through all its bugfixes, and is truly ready for release.  At least, if future games are still unplayable, I'll only be losing out on however much the sale price will be.

For those who see my hours and think my review can't be accurate:

I'm stubborn as hell and really wanted this game to work.  I continually sat through ridiculous load times just to have it freeze before finishing or crashing within a few minutes after.  My actual game time is less than 10% of what is says, despite having uninstalled and reinstalled the game half a dozen times (including once yesterday).
________________________________________________________
Second update:
Another patch that fixed zero problems for my experience.  I was able to have another session that lasted more than a couple hours, and it only took 50 more hours of trying to play.  This is getting to the point of excruciating.  It's sad when a franchise I've personally spent close to $800 on (probably more), have recommended to many people, and made the first game I needed to download Steam to play...sad when they release the title I most looked forward to and it is completely unplayable for me, no matter what I try.

If things change, I'll gladly delete all of this and replace it with the glowing review that the title would deserve if it worked.  If not, I'm sorry to say, this might be the end of my Total War obsession.  No new games, no DLC, no more telling everyone how superior these games are to all the rest.  I'll just play the older working titles I know and love, and find a new franchise to spend money on.  I really don't want it to come to that.  I'm as loyal a customer as it gets, but there must be a limit.
__________________________________________________________
Update:
They made a patch and everything worked better, longer sessions before crashing, less time to load, enjoyable experiences all around.  I still never exited the game voluntarily, as crashes were inevitable, but there was a significant amount of game play first.  That lasted for about two days.  Now we're back to constant crashes, every second time I click the end turn button (meaning each session is one turn), and now there's a lag issue on top of it.

I still can't open a ticket, because I still don't know all the stuff they ask for.  I did make sure all my drivers are updated, so it has nothing to do with that.  I really want to change this to a yes recommendation, because it was such a fun and enjoyable game for those two days.  Hopefully soon I'll be able to play it the way it's supposed to be played, and I can change this review for the last time.

________________________________________________________________________
I love TW, ever since the first Shogun was new.  I've been waiting for them to do a 3 Kingdoms inspired game since the first Rome was released.

The game is fun, if you're able to play it.  I had 10 hours of game time the first day, and almost 30 minutes were spent actually playing the game itself.  I finally was able to play for a couple hours last night before it all messed up again.  For the most part, I get about 2-5 minutes in before it crashes, often less.  I can't contact the support team because I'm just a casual gamer, not a software expert by any means, so I can't provide the details they want just to open a ticket.  My laptop isn't brand new, but it's new enough, and meets or exceeds all recommended stats.

I really just want to play my game, that's all.  But the load times are almost unbearable, and the almost immediate and incessant crashes make it literally unplayable.  Until it's fixed, I just can't bring myself to recommend it.  I hope others are having a better experience.",1558983525,1562096639,False,0.0,True,False,False,724,en

My hype died with yet another delay or so I thought. I bought the game once again through steam hours after it was unlocked and it was so worth it. This is by far the best TW to date. The soundtrack and overall look is beautiful and amazing. The battles on romance mode is what I expected being a 3k setting. The deeper campaign mechanics also make it so much more meaningful.

Ironically, the records mode battles are great... they were just not included in the ranked battle system so nobody is playing them. I tried playing romance mode, but the battles are all about buff spamming and killing enemy heroes. Generally, if your heroes die you loose and regular units have a very difficult time holding down and killing heroes. I gave up playing romance battles after a fought against a general that had a passive buff that caused all my opponent’s units to become unbreakable (and gave very good melee buffs) when the balance bar was in my favor. Anyone who played Rome 2 online battles knows that buff makes a battle almost unwinnable and takes all the strategy out of it.

I've wanted some hard campaigns since Attila introduced some great ones and Three Kingdoms definitely delivers. Bear in mind that I've only completed the campaign on Records mode with Yuan Shu so have yet to get around to Romance. I'll go into a pros/cons below but if you want a TL:DR  - Solid entry to the series that is definitely worth picking up.

Pros
-Art style and sound design is great
-Campaigns are long and challenging
-Family Trees
-New Setting
-Various methods of winning (war/economy/alliances) etc
-Reforms tree is awesome
-Retinue system streamlines army management
-(Probably more pros I cant think of off the top of my head)

Cons
-Movement speed on the campaign is really slow
-Campaign map is really dense
-Because of the above points, campaign movement often feels like a slog
-Fertility rates seem to be bugged (Haven't had one birth all game, i'm on turn 129 with two couples)
-Apart from unique characters, average generals looks bland and uninteresting 

The fertility issue might just be me and most of the cons will be fixed when modders jump on the scene so they aren't really anything to worry about. The game is definitely worth picking up :)",1558969532,1558969627,True,0.5199999809265137,True,False,False,205,en

This is because of the high end learning curve for the diplomacy.  CA managed to make the best diplomacy AI and fun factor I have ever seen, this is a double edged sword as well. It has a learning curve of immense level. The family tree, court, and diplomacy between everyone must all be taken into account. You do not want to have your generals splitting off in the middle of a war.

CONS :
- Game crashed at least 4 times in 3 days.
- Alliance and vassals almost means nothing. They easily and quickly can break deals and attacks you even if they are still weaker and you have a good reputations / friendship with them. Marriage means nothing, it doesn't do anything.
- Your even weak enemy comes and attacks you from long distance and nobody attacks them... But you can't do the same because lots of countries will start attacking you if you do.
- Unbalanced economy system. Doesn't matter how good you're with managing cities, upgrading them, keeping all resource districts in your hand. Buildings and army maintenance very expensive. You just can't keep up maintenance.
- It is hard to manage your characters; you need to do lots of click for single management. UX is terrible and very annoying.
- Hard to track countries on the map. Coloring system not well designed.
- Few character portraits for lots of chars. Too many characters looks similar to eachother.

+ Game has a big potential, lots of things to do and requires deep strategy.

For long-time Total War players the feel is that, they finally integrated the things that made Rome and both Medieval titles with the way they tried to do Empires thru Rome:2. (Atilla was an improvement on Rome:2's style imo). With diplomacy playing a huge role, but also having battle field actions have a massive impact on those diplomatic interactions. By simply besieging a settlement, you can turn alignments and treaties on end for rival factions (or your own lol). Very historically accurate as far as most believe, history of course is open to interpretation. The game does change, weather or not key events like Sun Jian's handing over of the Seal or Cao Cao' father's and Dong Zhou's assassinations, based on the events going on around them at the appropriate time. 

On the battlefield the controls are responsive, but at the same time units do what they ""think"" you want (kind of like commanding real units). Overall battle is very enjoyable similar to the way i felt about battle in the second thru fourth entries in the series, (Medieval, Rome, Medieval 2), with the added elements from later titles integrated flawlessly to create a new, yet familiar feel to combat. AND THERE ARE DUELS DURING COMBAT lol!! 

The visuals as expected are incredible. The picture pack is quite lacking with many famous characters sharing one basic picture per class. However many main characters have very well done personalized visuals. The Asian inspired sound track for the music is as expected. Voices are both great at times and very american sounding at others (very strange). Runs great, runs smooth under recommended settings on my above avg. Omen PC. Only 1 crash on over 40 hours of play and that was around 10 hours into a straight playthru (I attribute that to my PC lol).

HARD, even on easy you will find the game challenging if you are new or have been away for the past couple titles. I would say worth every penny of the 59.99+tax ticket. I would venture to say my hours spent in game will reach the thousands before the game becomes totally obsolete. Mind you I still play Total War: Rome from time to time and I believe that title is 15 years old or so. These games will make you feel like the leader of a historical faction and if you play the characters to their individual personalities they are incredible immersive. I recommend all Total War titles minus Rome 2 and Medieval as Medieval 2 and the original Rome are (imo) better representations of their eras.

It's a great game to buy early-on as the DLC seems to offer a completely new playstyle (as does every campaign character). I haven't tested the multiplayer as of yet but I hope to do so after toying around in my Sun Jian campaign. 
There are a few balance issues and nuisances such as towers being able to snipe your troops from huge distances and Yang Shuo creating 45 alliances/vassals before you've managed to move up to Duke but the game is overall beatable in so many ways that these balance issues may not ever effect you.

The difference between Total War and other strategy games is army morale. If a unit's morale breaks, it will flee from battle. This means if your strategy is sound, you can rout a larger, more powerful army by breaking their morale. Perhaps in a bid to appease players crying for longer battles, the morale system in Total War Three Kingdoms is trivialized. Units will just keep fighting to absurd length. I had a fight in which I had to completely kill off every soldier in enemy units or the enemy would only flee after suffering 95% casualty. It might be understandable if it were an elite unit, but those are just standard/early game units. Even peasant units would fight on as though they are heroic units and I'm only playing on normal difficulty! I feel as though I'm playing Starcraft in which enemies would just keep coming with zero regard for their lives.

Total War Three Kingdoms has also removed agents. In the past several games, these special characters form the eyes, ears and even the backstabbing hand of a faction leader. Now I'm just fighting blind without knowledge of where the enemy is coming from or what the enemy army's composition is. Is he going to come from the north? The south? Or is he chilling off somewhere and won't be coming for the next 20 turns? Creative Assembly has replaced the spying system, which is a mess since you have to develop quite a ways before being able to deploy your spy into the enemy's faction. This is bad since you do not have much resources in early game and you need to know which settlement is going to be under attack. Worse, the AI factions cheats and knows your army's location, so it would move south if you attempt to guard the north, or move north if you attempt to guard the south. Disgusting!

I regret my purchase of Total War Three Kingdoms, and would stick to Koei's RoTK series for a better, fuller Three Kingdoms experience.",1558927975,1558927975,False,0.4779132902622223,True,False,False,353,en

Pros:

To start, the graphics are amazing, especially at 4K and Ultra settings.  The map looks beautiful and the battle maps are packed with detail.  

The game play is what you've come to expect of a TW game, but the diplomacy has been greatly improved over all previous installments.

The full city sieges are back, as opposed ot the half city sieges offered in TW Warhammer

It's stable.  I have yet to experience crashing, bugs, or dropped FR in my time playing so far.

The unit balancing seems to be pretty spot on, although I think archers may be a little overpowered.

The Lord ""Duels"" is a nice touch and adds a bit more to the battles.

Cons:

The UI at the map screen is super cluttered. I kind of feel like I'm in front of one of those TV's from the movie Idiocracy where there are advertisments all around the TV screen edges while the show is playing.

Whle it is a nice feature, there is too little control over the Lords as they Duel.

The AI seems to have an easier time vassalizing and forming alliances than the player does.  I went to war with Cao Cao, and within 5 turns he created 5 vassals and all of those vassals in turn went to war with me.  Meanwhile, even with people I had positive 190 and up relationship scores with as well as being ""Trustworthy"" I could barely get a non-aggression treaty with.

All in all though, I think this is a great game, and if you haven't bought a Total War game in awhile because you've been put off by the fantasy aspect of TW Warhammer, or the mediocre releases like Atilla and Rome 2, then this is the game that will bring you back to the franchise.",1558927899,1558927899,True,0.5021337270736694,True,False,False,335,en

Even Chinese game industry themselves, like Tencent and Netease, can't achieve this attitude of shaping a game in this way (Maybe they never mean to?) I find myself lack the skill to describe the artistic level of it. When the BGM sounds, I feel my blood start burning as my warriors fighting for the mandate of the Dynasty. All Chaos should be banished!
The gameplay remains TW style, but you can choose whether to fight in romance or record. The record mode is traditionally what Total War is like before, your generals come into the field with his or her bodyguard, so don't order him charge the enemy too much. Or, you can try the romance mode, this way your general fights like a lord in Warhammer. The enemy? die die!
Of course, there's still problems.
I noticed that when my coalition upgrading to military alliance, my relationship to the members deteriorated. I don't know why.
Yuan Shao is a little too powerful, I've seen him making tons of vassal many times, even Cao Cao who defeated him in history.
I didn't find how to let my spy return from mission.
Some of the randomly generated names of common characters not suit the Chinese naming tradition.
The AI controlled Dong Zhuo dies too fast, maybe that's because history?

Cons
- Unique characters are at serious undersupply. At late game, all the uniques die out and the game gets much less dramatic.
- Could be a bit challenging for the beginners of Total War series in general. But man, this is always the case for any of the Total War titles.
- Reform (Tech) UI is beautiful, but it fails its most fundamental function of propagating information.
- Multiplayer is less intensive than TW: Warhammer 2.
Pros
- Absolutely fantastic optimization. Much faster than TW: Warhammer 2 despite all the graphics and stuff.
- Rarely for the TW series, no critical bugs even at the point of release. This was also the case for the TW: Warhammer series but hey, everybody expect bugs from a TW title since Rome 2, and TW has a infamy of becoming playable a year after release.
- TW: Warhammer-like Romance mode and Historical Records mode freely selectable
- The oriental-schemed graphics are absolutely beautiful.
- CA has finally perfected its diplomatic AI. AIs are incrdibly smart, almost being intimidating.
- Good balance between strategic settlement management and combat tactical management. TW: Rome 2 had too intense settlement management, while TW: Warhammer was too simplified.
- Historically accurate representation of political situation of China, where warlords aspire to be the emperor but nonetheless acknowledges the authority of the puppet emperor of Dong Zhuo.

Dong Zhuo will be a dick, Yuan Shao will try to vassalize most of the map, Cao Cao will likely try to instigate proxy wars (""Won't fight the war yourself? What's the matter General Cao, chicken?"") Liu Bei will be a steadfast and honorable opponent etc etc. These characters carry over into the battles with 3 officers per army, and six retinue units per officer. Each officer has a different specialty which effects which units they can recruit. Strategists (the blue guys) recruit skilled archers and artillery, Sentinels (the green boys) can recruit spearmen, The red generals can recruit cavalry, yellow guys can recruit cavalry and axe infantry. However, basic militia trained units are available to all officers regardless of color class. So red guys can recruit archer militia or sabre militia, just not the advanced units. When the battle is joined (and what gorgeous battles they are, CA really nailed the aesthetic here. Bright sunsets filter through tree canopies, each unit has about a dozen flag bearers that plant their flag before they fight allowing you to track the battles progress in an organic fashion, the campaign map is loaded with details and helpful geographic pointers so you can know your Yangtze from a hole in the ground. And the map accurately reflects that southern China is God's own land, a gorgeous paradise of lush greenery and soaring mountains that seems like it's almost out of a fantasy movie.) When the battle is joined your officers can duel or get challenged to duel the enemies' officers which turn into quite fun little duel battles that remind me of that John Woo movie Red Cliff, acrobatic attacks lend your officers a sort of superhuman, larger-than-life persona perfectly in keeping with the romance aspect of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Watching Ma Chao cut through a group of Jian infantry like he was right out of the Warhammer games is quite thrilling to watch. 

Overall one of the best in the Total War series period.

Another tip, go onto wikipedia and listen to the pronunciation of the characters name so you don't call Cao Cao ""Cow Cow"" It is ""Sao Sao"" or ""Chow Chow"" like in Red Cliff (which I'm pretty sure is the Cantonese pronunciation) Lu Bu is ""Lee Boo""  I had friends that played Dynasty Warriors and kept calling people by the wrong name, so look up the names before you sound like a tool.",1558922000,1558922000,True,0.0,True,False,False,511,en

-The map and graphics at least for me are very well done and look good.
-They added a lot of complexity to the campaign map improving both diplomacy and town development over that of attila allowing more choices though less than some of the older games.
-A large map with many factions 
-They did a great job making you feel like your playing a RoTK game.
The bad
-Very little replayablity as the game seems to develop much the same way everytime as well as a major lack of variation between factions. I expected this as it is the nature of a historical game set in one culture but it appears they didnt even try to give them much difference. Rome 2, Attila,  Med 1&2, and of course warhammer 1&2 all have far more faction difference and replayablity.
- Battles are decent in records mode and allow for some strat but go far too fast and as I said before no matter who you are you build the same army.
-Romance mode is more or less unplayable for me. I expected something like heros from warhammer where they are powerful but still need a army to back them up but they went way overboard to the point what units you choose dont matter in fact units dont matter at all. A single hero can win a entire army thus it is no fun at all and no strat at all.
-Lazy choice of not doing ship battles.
- Battles seem smaller than any other total war oddly enough for a game in china.

 I Believe that expansions should fix most of these issues such as adding the nanman and mods many of the others such as weakening heros but until then I cannot recomend this game unless you are a major fan of either chinese history or the novels.

+Very good looking, nice music, characters very recognisable from the source material.
+Large variety of factions with different challenges and playstyle recommendations, kudos for this, a more pedestrian effort would have just made the main 3 (Wei Wu and Shu) playable.
+Options for both more traditional style game (records) and more epic/heroic style game (romance). Kudos for this, it even affects the visuals, as records is more historically accurate, romance more fantastical.
+AI seems to have quite different personalities depending on the characters and faction.
+Better late game than in previous titles, the AI tends to blob up (and split apart) more like you might see in a paradox game, and there's usually a challenge to be had toward the late game, as someone in the other half of the map has done the same thing you have.
+Agents have essentially gone, though the intel gathering aspect is managed through a spying sub mechanic.

Cons
-Majority of factions are surrounded by potential enemies, and most of the territory you'll lose in this game will be because you're fighting a several front war and can't be everywhere at once.
-Further more to this, armies seem to take a very long time to get around the map, and you'll do a lot of fighting against enemies where you're essentially ""swapping"" territory as you are both attacking the vast areas that you each can't defend. Both of these are extremely frustrating
-Replenishment in the early game is very slow, and you're likely to be sitting there a long time waiting for units to replenish. Building armies is a lot, lot slower than in total war warhammer, and recovering unit strength is slower still. This makes it exponentially more difficult when you're fighting more than one faction at once.
-Very high price point for the game at the moment.
-High population causes negative happiness/public order, this is a bugbear that has come back from earlier games. It feels a bit stupid to upgrade a city to get more slots, only to have to use these slots on happiness buildings as bigger cities have more pop and therefore a bigger happiness debuff. I'm sure this will soon be fixable with a mod.

Mixed or opinion elements
+/- Much more complicated building and province management. In total war Warhammer there's usually just one building for income, for example, here there are tons, and income is divided into different types, and you have to build support buildings that give a +% to certain types of income. You can appoint governors and send people on assignments. Some people are going to like this intricate sort of micromanagement, but I really don't and prefer the simpler buildings/provinces from Warhammer.
+/- Army construction is different, rather than a general (or lord, depending on what other game you're comparing) your army is composed of up to three characters, each of whom has up to six units following them (their retinue). Certain characters give better buffs to certain units, and some units are exclusive to certain character types. A plus for trying to be historically accurate (this was the age of warlords). In my opinion though, this system is more trouble than it's worth, and would prefer just to be able to recruit a stack of units like in the olden days.
+/- Role playing elements. Characters need to be satisfied (this is quite hard early game, very easy later on), and can have friendships and rivalries with others. If you've played the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" series, it's the same idea. However, there are a lot of random events that spring up, and some give pretty bad consequences, -as it's random, you can't mitigate or prepare for it, really, it just means be prepared to reload a lot. Overall I would say that the relationships and satisfaction element is more trouble than it's worth, and the whole characters system is something I'd rather I could switch off, particularly as you have to pay all these characters a wage.
+/- Big and complicated diplomacy system that is also vitally important. There are a lot of UI improvements over previous games, but diplomacy is much more important in this title, and is almost overwhelming. Ancient warlords hired wise fellows whose job it was to keep track of alliances, vassals and grudges, and halfway through a campaign you'll feel like you'll want to do the same thing.


Please Note that as of the time of writing this there are still bugs, but I'm pretty sure these will eventually be fixed. For example, I've noticed armies sometimes just don't reinforce each other for seemingly no reason, and it's possible for armies to just walk in and out of cities that are under siege (those sentries must be useless). There were a few problems earlier on with Yuan Shao vassalizing everyone, but this seems to have stopped. Some people are complaining that towers are overpowered, but I haven't noticed this yet.

TL/DR
This is a good game, and with mods/more development it's going to be even better. I don't find it as much ""fun"" as total war warhammer, which is more focused on constantly and quickly pushing armies together, but this is pretty good. I was going to not recommend and say definitely get this game but wait for the price to come down, but on second thoughts that just feels a little cheap. This is probably one of the much more involved and challenging total war games, but if you're up for that, get the game when the price feels right for you, either now or in a year's time.

I want to break down my review into different total war ""features"" and how 3K competes in each area.

1. Diplomacy - 20 / 10
I say this because three kingdoms has revolutionized the diplomacy system, in just countless ways. Not only does the AI make smarter, more believable decisions, there is a great improvement to the depth and intrigue in diplomacy. This has been the short leg on the total war table for literally 20 years at this point and it has finally been improved to create an engaging and immersive experience. You might not think diplomacy is all that interesting, but I think it very heavily impacts what KIND of wars you fight. You can actually make allies of your closest rivals and even influence diplomacy in unique ways with special characters like Cao Cao. In this way, diplomacy changes the total war playstyle less from a ""gobble up one enemy at a time"" sort of mechanic to more of an integrated system of loaylties and betrayals. Thats sounds super corny, but its really there.

2. Graphics - 9 / 10
Not the coolest unit models, but the graphical performance is the best the series has ever seen. I can use the extreme unit size (240 men per unit) with the highest graphical settings with no noticeable drop in FPS with my GTX980 intel i7 setup. Also, the unit model detail is less important considering just how stylized everything is. It perfectly complements the setting and the ""fantasy"" like feel to it, even when you play on records mode.

3. Campaign - 10 / 10
Not only are the different playable factions interesting and unique (Yes specific characters and factions DO have unique units, contrary to what some people seem to think), but I am finding myself much more interested in interesting generals and administrators beyond the previous systems, even in total war warhammer (where I admitedly built every character basically the exact same way to fit my playstyle). 

Also, another thing I don't see anyone talking about: You can split off generals from your armies to form detached armies!!!! People have been complaining that you get stuck with a big 20 stack that can't split its forces ever since Rome 2 and now you finally can do this again! Why would you do this? Lets say you invade an enemy territory with a full stack, and the enemy moves a small force out of their home region to counter attack you somewhere else. In the last 5 total war games you had to choose between using your 20 stack to chase down this raiding army (time consuming!!) or continuing on and attacking the enemy lands while yours get pillaged. No more! Now you can just detach one of your generals from the 20 stack and send him to chase down the raiders. Plus this should also massively aid the problem where the AI retreats from you endlessly if you outnumber them. Now you could just detach a general from your force (perhaps to act as a garrison temporarily) while your remaining 14 units engage the AI. 

3. Battles 8 / 10
I havent actually fought enough sieges and land battles to comment too much on this. Also, it seems like in romance mode, the ""battle"" is a total sideshow compared to duels which are more deterministic. You can easily just play records mode if you don't like this, and its honestly just as fun. Instead of powerful character abilities and duels to the death, you just use tactics to win the day. Definitely not as bad as some battles in some total war games, but it does need some balancing. Like for example ranged units not only have insane range on their weapons, they also just disintegrate units in seconds before running out of ammo. To counter this, ranged units have like 1/2 the health of melee troops which makes no sense to me... they get slaughtered by the bucket load when you hit them with even light cavalry. 

However another thing I dont see people talking about is the combination units. You now have units that actaully have multiple weapon loadouts opperating in tandem. Also every unit has gorgeous flags flying in the wind carried by actual soldiers!! Remember med 2 when there were floating flags?? Yes now we actually have flag bearers. And these mechanics are totally open for modders to use to make all sorts of combo units, perhaps with sword champions leading regiments or making more diverse general's bodyguards.

4. UI: 10 / 10
Very solid. Pretty to look at, but super useful and easy to learn. I also love the almost ""mobile game"" style buildings and unit card portraits.

5. Naval warfare 0 / 10
This is a bummer because chinese naval combat fighting RIVER BATTLES would be probably the coolest thing you could add to this game. I've always wanted to see river battles with limited width rivers, varying tides and currents affecting combat... better luck next time i guess.

1. Food consumes most of my build slots. I get that you need food, but man it seems almost scarce; and all the other factions's food is ""Very Poor"" or just ""Poor.""

2. Everyone wants to kill me.  I don't conquer too vehemently, but when everyone is trying to kill me, signs a peace treating, AND TWO TURNS LATER goes back on that treaty (looking at you Gongsun Zan) I trust no one. This isn't really that bad I suppose compared to everyone laying chill, but man I am at war.

3. Diplomats ask too much of me. Oh, AlexSaved wants a simple trade deal? that's fine...I JUST NEED SIX OF HIS SPECIAL ITEMS, 10 TURNS OF GOLD AND FOOD TRIBUTE, AND A LUMP SUM. In return, my trade rights. NOTHING ELSE. Like come on man, you aren't that special! At first it was Dong Zhuo and I was like ""ok, that makes sense"" but then it became Liu Bei and Sun Jian. I mean Liu Bei for crying out loud.

4.  Character appearances could be of more quantity. Do I play RoTK and am spoiled by special portraits from every officer? Yes, I get that, but I feel some characters could be more ""special."" Unique appearances, is what I'm getting at. Perhaps it's me used to RoTK, like I said earlier.

Besides those things, I am very impressed with the Total War team. Animations don't lag, nothing skips despite the graphics being good, implaments of duels and other Three Kingdom stigmas; it pretty much is well rounded. You have a lot of factions to choose from right at the start, which is cool. I wish they did more timelines though, but 9/10 that'll be DLC. Also, I wish they had some different characters to play as. Overall!

Campaign is probably one of the best in the series however AI still cheats

- Unit Combat/animations  have taken a huge hit only with improvement with the generals. Literally Rome Total War 2 has better unit to unit combat. Also units/cavalry don't put up their shields while being pelted with 1000s of arrows.
- Retreat with ambushed is broken. The evac point is useless
- Arrow Trails looked like they were made by an intern
- Unit replishment is a little too hard for AI and player but need a mechanic for player/ai to not get screwed after losing one battle, and time before next attack from a huge army if loses are met

9.5/10

(My experience had been on playing VH/VH campaigns with max settings and unit size) 

I would recommend this TW:3k to anyone that is a lover off Chinese history or a fan of strategy games.  
Three Kingdoms is a breath of fresh air too the old and venerable total war franchise. This game is a real contender to be my personal ""Best Total War game TO DATE"", see me when i hit 500 hours in game to confirm. 


THE GOOD 

- A choice between full historic ""records mode"" and the larger than life ""romance mode"" that drastically changes the game.  appealing to both sides of total wars fan base. 

- I have never known a total war game to be this optimised at release.  

- The new diplomacy system makes the old one seem dull and bland. There are a lot of new options as well as returning fan favorites like region trading. The quick deal option is also a very handy quality of life improvement that saves times instead of having to check faction after faction to see who is willing to trade. 

- The new duel system has some very good animations that i struggle to tear my eyes away from. It also sets up some very nice cinematic moments. For example in one of my battles my army and my rivals moved up to just outside of the range of each other when the AI challenged one of my generals to a duel. The two armies just watched as the epic fight took place. 

-Despite being a mono culture game it still manages to keep factions feeling unique compared to other historic TW titles. A lot of factions have there own resource + the starting positions have the most variation in flavour i have seen in a TW game. The factions also all have units only they can recruit that also have a lot of flavour.   

- The new unit extreme unit size makes battles feel much bigger due the extra men and units holding out longer. 

- The character system is outstanding. From the gear to find and use feeling very valuable too the character winning duels and developing under your very eyes, YOU WILL get attached... and YOU WILL be devastated when that character you loved and where just about to get to legendary status dies. 

- Characters taunting and conversing with each other never gets old. Double so when you find unique ones. 

- unique characters have A LOT of flavour

- Army organisation - Each general having there own retenue that they buff and follow them when leaving joining not just an army but a faction is very nice indeed + having to chose witch character commands an army over all and brings his buff to the table is a nice touch there too. 

- Your factions internal court politics are quite nice. Powerful characters in your faction expect to be rewarded with valuable positions / roles and promotions. 

-The much loved family tree is in game. 

- The relationship system for characters is very simple early game and does not seem to mean much more than a satisfaction buff but as the game goes on its shows its true potential in the form of an exrta layer too add too your other areas of game play. For example your spy makes a sworn brother as he is fighting and building his power... a big battle nears and its now time for him to show his hand and rejoin your faction BUT can he convince his new mate to join the scheme ? 

- Siege battles look very promising this time around. The last couple of total war games have had some very lack poor siege battles. So far i have only fought about 5 siege battles (1 was a custom battle) but i am quite impressed by them so far.   

- The graphics are outstanding. Both the campaign map and the battles are of outstanding quality and do an awesome job representing the Chinese landscape and culture of the time. 

- The new spy system is very nice. Who should you trust... what if that character you just adopted turns out to be working for your rival ? This system just get better in MP campaigns where you can NEVER trust your character recruitment pool. 

- BIG FAN favorite characters from the 3k time period such as Cao Cao and the dreaded LU BU !!!

- The UI works well and looks good ... for the most part. 

- The much loved settlement battles are back for un-walled settlements. 

- Settlement management has had improvements with population returning to replace growth. Buildings branching + having a larger amount of upgrades (the main settlement building goes all the way up to level 10) 

- The music is outstanding


THE NEUTRAL 

- The max army size has been increased from 20 though only by 1... and you have slightly less choice in selecting your units as 3 slots will always be a general in a max sized army ( 3 generals who can have a retenue of 6 units each) 

- The voice acting though good does not have much flavour.  

- Generic characters could use more variation and feel very bland until they start lvling up and get some gear. 

- The A.I is a very important part of any strategy game. Here it seems neither exceptional or lacking. It just gets the job done. 


THE BAD

- The full fantasy setting from warhammer has spoiled us on the battle front. Though battles feel flavourfull and in depth compared to other historic titles, they do not reach the levels of a full fantasy game thanks to the lack of magic, flying units ect ect. 

- Once again we have been spoiled by the fantasy setting of previous games as even though the factions have a lot of diversity for a historical title... there is not much compared too warhammer with actual different races never mind cultures.  

- Though the animations for duels are outstanding about 1 in 4 duels have a period where they will stop using the breath taking animations and start using a couple of sub par ones that will repeat 4 or 5 times in a row ruining the ""spectator"" aspect of the player sitting back and watching the duel. 

- The outstanding animations in duels are ruined a bit in the ""finishers"" thanks to the lack of any blood or gore what so ever. It breaks the immersion + feels incomplete without any.  

- Though most of the UI is good trying to mouse over the unit info on the left or click the +/- for expanded info is rather unintuitive at first thanks to it just disappearing without you clicking on a unit and even worse when your in the middle of recruiting units.

2932,50867832,76561197992793681,73,13,114.8,0.55,1562521802,"The Good:

- Grand strategy is improved, and vastly better than previous Total War titles. They really managed to pull something coherent together and it shows in playstyles. Not everything is about battles, which is great.

- It's beautiful to look at.

- Cavalry and archers actually matter. It makes flanking, and out-manoeuvering your opponents that much more satisfying.

- I really, really like the sieges. On the attacking side, it's a bit boring because all you have to do is overwhelm the opponent. But defending can be like a puzzle. Where to put your units, how to prevent archers from setting fire to your city, etc.

- The introduction of fires to the battlefield is a nice touch -- shows how polished the game is. (It can scare and hurt your units)

- The battle AI is noticeably smarter (sometimes). 

Example: I was flanking them on both sides with shock cav and they sent out their melee cav with heavy spearmen to guard their rear. They managed to stay close to their archers the entire battle and it was a genuine challenge to get around them. It surprised me.

Needs Work:

- The UI is great sometimes, and at other times it's unnecessarily confusing. For example, the tech tree takes too long to load and it's hard to understand (they really need to change this). Unit cards / stats are too confusing -- just put the stat next to a number.

- Characters level up WAY too slowly. This has always been an issue in historical TW series -- your character dies of old age like two turns after they become useful. They need to change this.

- The recruitment system is cool... but it feels so much less controlled, and there's a lack of variety. It just made me feel like most of the time I was throwing random units together rather than building a real army. 

By the same token, I think it was a good idea to get rid of ""buildings-unlock-unit"" for this title (you don't need to build a bowery to get archers, etc.). It frees up the city-building to be more about infrastructure/economy, which is nice, plus you don't have to constantly think about where you built certain recruitment centers (which I always found annoying).

- Battles are fun?... My main experience has been ""This is Shogun but not as good."" It's lacking a ""wow"" factor. 

- Duels are pretty whatever. They don't really do anything other than (hopefully) take out a general. But there's no incentive to do them because you can just keep your generals alive and troll their archers.

^ I still think the morale debuff that comes from your general losing a duel is a bit... too much. In the current system, if two generals lose their duels your entire army routs. It makes for some cool storytelling (""I was about to lose this huge battle but we won these duels and saved the day!"") but it's too easy to cheese imo.",1558891132,1558967110,True,0.0,True,False,False,502,en

1. The hardware limits; this game can be very taxing on a mid-range PC, i personally have a Ryzen 7 and a GTX 1070 and i run hot on this game with no OC. so make sure that you have adequate cooling and at least the hardware listed on the recommended list to have a good experience. 

2. The Generals in this game can make or break a battle; the new general system in this game allows you to make separate armies in the battle under the same user and each general has their strengths and weaknesses. For example Cao Cao is a good leader and can hold the line in an open field charge while Zhao Yun can hold a chokepoint the entire battle with his men. There is a new level of depth that can be explored and goes even deeper in campaign where there is general friendships and other things of such that can be the difference between saving a city from a siege with 2-1 odds against you or not. 

3. Turn on the sound... this game sounds great and the amount of detail put into the units character art and the audio. Also zoom in on the battle from time to time, there are chants and singing while the battle is happening. 

4. Don't get too attached to generals in the campaign, because things happen and it's like history's equivalent of game of thrones. -\/(:D)\/-

5. You need to be patient. This game can be difficult to pick up and start playing right away. But putting in a few hours to get feel for it will give you the skills and foresight to make decisions and play well. It may be best to start on easy setting if you are a new player or play the tutorial to learn the mechanics an build off them. There are lots of different ways you can plan and win a match, but the same goes for the other guy too. Kinda like a more realistic chess game...

In my opinion, this is a very well made game and is somewhat easy to pick up and start playing. If you are a fan of the series then not too much has changed from previous renditions, similar campaign structure with the turn based overworld and the RTS battles. The dev did add some new things such as the generals and the Duels where they can boost or lessen moral for the troops based on the victor. If you are a new player, the game is pretty strait forward to pick up using the basic ""rock, paper, scissors"" mentality, the tutorials are decent and will tell you the basics. However, it is really up to you to decide how you play because, like chess, the real point of the game is make it so you can exploit the blunders of the other team; which comes with time and practice. 

Some other things that someone could benefit from knowing: During battle the generals can talk trash; while cool, can get repetitive. Also some of the accents are so bad it's laughable. And a couple of times during online battles I had the game lag to the point where it was in slomo the entire battle, but that could have just been my connection-your mileage may very

I can't remember having played a Total War game that is almost flawless from a technical point of view. In 1080p or 1440p performance is amazing on high settings and animations are very smooth. There are barely any glitches or bugs that I've noticed after 9 hours of playing. 

Although I was skeptic in the faster pacing of battles due to Generals that act like heroes in the Romance mode I can luckily say that my worries were misplaced. Having heroes engage on the battlefield increases the fun factor while battles, when fought strategic could still take quite some time. I haven't encountered weird AI behavior yet but it seems to be an improvement over previous games.

What is truly amazing is politics, diplomacy and managing your court. There are so many options to engage in any of those areas within the game which is a positive development. So far I'm happy and looking forward to the blood & gore DLC. Base game I give a 9 / 10

The game is very well polished and has had lots of thought and care put into its development. From the newbie friendly UI and tutorial to the artistic style and redesigned diplomacy, Three Kingdoms really improves on everything that makes this series worthwhile. (It gets kinda long from here on out TLDR at the bottom)

COOP Squeal: A friend of mine and I are playing through a coop campaign (Props that we aren't hard locked to be either friend or foe, we decided to hard lock ourselves nonetheless but definitely props to just letting us start the game and go at it) and are absolutely loving the experience. We played through Shogun 2 together and had a blast but we're already a few hours in and haven't even fully scratched the surface of Three Kingdoms yet. Our empires grow independently of each other. Our wars play out independent of one another despite the fact that we agreed to share the mandate of heaven(the hard-lock for coop victory). It feels more fluid and real that way. While my friend fights a war to the East, I fight to the West and we don't have to worry about being attacked from the other direction despite this. He fights with Yuan Shao's coalition behind him while I stand alone against Dong Min along the Yellow River. I've never felt a campaign feel so alive like this. It's almost like two separate stories playing out on the same map. We aren't just one faction(in essence that is) slowly gaining power. We were separate entities working towards a common goal.

Romance vs Records: Absolutely love CA for putting in this option. For those that have never played Total War before this, Records is the quintessential experience for classic Total War gameplay. Unit fatigue matters, the generals come with a bodyguard, and it puts more emphasis on the tactical. Romance is what you'd expect a story about the Three Kingdoms Era to be. Larger than life figures represented in your single unit generals that can stand toe to toe with hordes of enemies (within reason, they can die.) On top of that, these generals can also duel one another in a very nice looking battle that feels isolated amidst the battle raging around them. On top of that, it puts emphasis on the relationships that these characters can form with one another. Yes, you read that right. Relationships. Characters like and dislike others based on a number of things. Their personality, personal experiences with them, even who they supported in the past and more. All of these factor into how they feel about one another. People who dislike one another may come to butt heads on the same team and may even cause uprisings if given a position of power. Again, it adds to that living breathing world that I talked about in the coop part of this review.

Diplomacy: God, I love you CA for this. Diplomacy no longer feels too much like a chore to deal with. People who hate you will understandably require more incentive to deal with you. Want a trade agreement with someone you were at war with? You better be willing to pay quite a bit. The flipside is also pretty nice, those that like you will require less to convince them to do things with you. The best part? It can all change on a whim. Understandably, the more powerful you get, the more likely someone who was once your friend may be your bitter rival/enemy in a bid for the throne. It doesn't just feel random anymore, you can see the build up occurring. (Also, love that I can trespass on people's land. It pisses them off yes. But it isn't automatic war. Love that change.) The new options available for trade help deepen what is possible.

Battles: Eh, what can I say. They're pretty much the same. AI is pretty stupid below Hard difficulty and even at Hard, they're still kinda stupid. Just play it smart. (But, I gotta say. Love the attention to detail. Fire arrows will set fire to trees, shrubs, and buildings if they hit them.)

Map: The map doesn't feel cluttered or cramped despite the amount of people fighting alongside it. This holds true even with the coop.

TLDR: I only have about 7 hours on it at the writing of this review so I'm not super knowledgeable on the intricacies of the systems. It's a solid and good entry into the Total War series. I would definitely suggest picking it up when you can if you enjoy these kinds of game.",1558887119,1558887119,True,0.501915693283081,True,False,False,780,en

-runs and looks better then warhammer 2 for me. got a rtx 2080 ti with a i7 8700k and can run everything ultra with extreme unit size on 1440p with ease.
- on the campaign map the computer is a actually challenge where in warhammer you could snowball pretty easy mid to late game here 100 turns in and you can still find yourself in a spot where you can get overwhelmed.
-diplomacy is finally fleshed out and it added allot of stuff that i wanted from warhammer. 

The cons:
-i said it runs great, but i have had multiple crashes already where the screen would freeze for 5 seconds shut it self off. hopefully they will fix that soon.
-it seems they really focused on the campaign map, cause the battles are abit meh compared to warhammer and the generals/heroes talents are pretty boring overal.

I am more of a MP so I will focus mostly on criticism (mainly because CA focused on campaign and did nothing for MP)
Pros:
-Amazing optimization. 
-Lots of innovations in campaign
-2 modes so that different communities could hf
-different unit cards
-duels look pretty nice 
-characters actually matter
-beautiful artwork
so basically everything in campaign lmao
Cons:
-MP campaign is still limited (by max number of players)
-There are some bugs, like campaign map going all white (fixed it by loading autosave)
-The balance in romance mode is pretty bad. The abilities of some gens are insane, like -100 morale, global silence so 1 player cannot use any abilities during the battle etc.
-Ranked can be played only in romance. Also when I start searching for ranked battles I can't go back so if I want to play campaign instead I have to alt+f4 and start the game again lol.
-Records mode is boring, because CA didn't add anything to it. How I wish they reused avatar system for it....
-Still no gen speeches (even tho there are some scripted, but medieval 2 gen speeches are 10x better)
-Kinda chaotic tab in custom battle. Would have been much better to use the old faction system. Now ppl will get so confused what to pick with all of these heroes.
-Last but not least the insane lagfest when Europeans are playing with/vs Chinese. 
Having said that we need to keep in mind that TW games at release date have never been exactly balanced or polished and this is one of their best release to date.

Some liberties taken aside (like how women are allowed to lead armies when they are mostly relegated to ruling from behind the curtain [and being a food source in an emergency] in the novel), the game is very faithful to the novel while also allow you to meaningfully affect the storylines.  I really feel like I am controlling the characters I read so much about and guide their actions so that your chosen champion would be able to unify the Empire for the greater good. 

This Total War, like all the previous ones, are divided into two distinct parts, the Campaign and the battle. In the campaign, you develop your cities, raise and move armies, manage  your faction's economy and diplomacy, as well as the relationship between your generals. There are quite a few new or revamped mechanics from older games. Food is back now and is slightly less irritating than it was in Attila, though finding good farmlands is still crucial to your faction's survival. Also, diplomacy is almost entirely overhauled and are both complicated and accessible now. How every faction in the game has the 'everyone for themselves' mentality and, while they don't betray others without a cause, are quite keen on looking for causes for betrayal, which is quite reminiscence of the novel.
The new systems of relationship is also very well done and very reflective of the novel's story, wherein basically everyone got betrayed at least once. If you can't keep your generals satisfaction up, you will see them leaving or even tearing your faction apart from within. 

In battle, where you throw your preciously cultivated army from the campaign against the enemies' armies, the battle is made fast paced, as are with all the last few Total War games. So if you prefer the slower paced battles like in Medieval 2, this might disappoint you. On the other hand the faster paced battles can be very invigorating to those who prefer it this way. 
The battles in this game are now more focused on the generals than the troops, even more so than the battles with magic-wielding and giant monsters-riding heroes of Total Warhammer. Famous generals from the novel can easily take down hundreds if not thousands of regular troops, especially the militia (I have had one of them killing 700+ men losing less than half his health) while the random nameless people can take down at least a hundred, and elite dragon troops fare only somewhat better than their militia counterparts. While this might sound excessive, it does make a kind of sense in the context of the novel, in which duels between generals decide around 80% of the battles.
The aesthetics of combat is, to me, top-notched. The matched combat between general is just mind blowing, while matched animations return for the regular troops as well, though in a much rarer proportion than in Shogun 2 and Rome 2, where in a battle is basically mass duels. Depending on your opinion on matched combat, this can be either frustrating or awesome.

All in all, my love for the novel might have biased me greatly towards the game. Still, I can truly say that I thoroughly enjoy this experience. The feeling I have as I control my childhood hero Liu Bei and give him the victory he deserves is just priceless and I can't recommend the game enough.",1558882684,1558882684,True,0.0,True,False,False,592,en

Battle gameplay:
In Romance mode: Aside from duels and optimization, there was not improvement but there was downgrading. Units felt like peasants of brettonia from Warhammer and even worse. Battles are just about Lords in this game. They must improve battle gameplay.
In Records mode: Well with no duels the one things which was good will not be present in Records mode. Battles are slightly longer.  All  of the Generals are on horseback, no spear, no sword unit.

Long time Total War veteran going all the way back to Shogun 1 in the summer of 2000, i have owned and played every Total War game in the series (aside from the fluff non core games like tactics).

3 Kingdoms is off to a great start as someone who suffered through the initial releases of Rome 2, Empire and even Shogun 2 to an extent which all had their share of bugs, crashes and infuriating design decisions.

The game runs butter smooth, i have a good rig admittedly but cranking almost everything to the highest settings apart from AA and shadows set to medium gives me ~60fps in the in game benchmark at 1440p.

The AI seems more competent than most other TW titles.

The diplomacy side of the game has gotten nice extra features but i have yet to really put it to the test.

The focus on characters is a big plus for the series, it's not quite the full blown CK2 esque experience that i hope to get someday but its a lot lot better than previous TW attempts at making characters interesting.

The additions to the campaign are also interesting and so far they seem good.

About the only negative stuff that i have to say is a few small UI issues like when you capture an enemy character it is not clear (or maybe even possible?) to tell if that character would work well with your existing ones given the new relationship system in the game.

Overall a solid start (among the best of the series IMO) and i look forward to seeing what the modders end up doing with the game once workshop support goes live.",1558872485,1558872485,True,0.0,False,False,False,298,en

the portraits are COOL[spoiler] (love Sun Ren)[/spoiler]，though the number is NOT enough（well...dlc）

then the problems...

1. If one side retreats during a fight, it will move some distance, which will prevent the other side from catching up during the round. So the two sides could not fight but only play “catch me if u can” all the time. i  hope this mechanism will improve.
And the time for each round is too long. FIVE rounds= ONE year！！！The march distance is too short by comparison.

2. The recruitment system is a mess. I am LiuBei and I'm able to recruit CaoZhi after killing CaoCao for two years. What's going on man？？？it was ur FATHER.....
And having children is a little difficult... There is also some confusion about succession. Why is it that after SunJian's death, the successor is Mrs. Wu instead of SunQuan or SunCe...

3. There is no castle to keep people from my lands.No HuLao Guan，no Tong Guan...only cities.
It happens that a small army comes to my capital noiselessly and I don't know what they want. As if the military right of way doesn't make sense.

The campaign is truly amazing.

When a whole coalition declares war on you, you get that ""OH FUCK"" feeling. This gives more of a challenge then previous total war games.

On the warlords selection screen you can see that Yuan Shao focused strategy is Alliances. He had the lineage. In the book and in history, he was selected to be the leader of the coalition against Dong Zhou. He ordered Liu Biao to ambush Sun Jian to get the imperial seal and Liu Biao had to conceded to his demand, causing the Liu Biao vs Sun family conflict and eventually the death of Sun Jian. ALL THAT just goes to show you how much authority he had. Before his defeat at Guan Du, he was arguably the strongest warlord at the time and even in that battle, he outnumbered Cao Cao greatly too. His empire only fell apart after his death and his sons fought each other for succession, leaving Cao Cao to pick them off one by one.

Diplomacy is hard in this game and it reflects the kind of common backstabbing in the era. If you keep an eye on Yuan Shao, it's not hard to keep him in check. Better yet, butter him up and be his best friend, steer him toward conflicts with bigger warlords like Cao Cao and reap the benefits. there is no shame to be the underdog here because not all warlords is balanced in term of power in this era. If you are not Yuan Shao or Cao Cao, it's ok to be the underdog and let them duke it out while picking up the pieces.

For my first campaign, I was playing Liu Bei and mobbing up the Guangling region with my main army. I turn my attention up north to Kong Rong and to avoid diplomatic penalty, I cancelled my non-aggression pact with him first. And you know what happened next? before I had a chance to move north, the dude took the initiative, taking the diplomatic penalty and storm my land with his full force. I lost Jian Young and Liu Bei was wounded just to push him back. When my main force with Zhang Fei and Guan Yu returned and I was about to take revenge on him, he ceded to become a vassal of Yuan Shao. Meaning, I can't go to war with him unless I want to take on the superpower. 

Am I frustrated? YES
Am I mad? NO. How can I? He DID EXACTLY what I would have done in that situation and that was wonderful. playing the diplomacy game. 

It's now turn 150, after become Yuan Shao's best friend, I was the second most poerful warlord after we hit Cao Cao hard. When Yuan Shao died, his son declared as emperor and everyone hated that (obviously) so I joined them to pick off his empire piece by piece :))",1558837987,1558839350,True,0.0,True,False,False,479,en

There's so many playstyles you can go with one playthrough or another playthrough of this game it not repetitive at all. Currently, I am playing the Pokemon game of catching all the generals to create the most elite force ancient China has ever seen before working together.

I am just hoping they can release the Blood & Gore DLC very soon to spice up battles a bit. It almost seems mandatory now in Total War games to have blood and gore, without it seems very bland in my opinion.

People who grew up playing Koei's Dynasty Warriors will love this game. Various modders from previous Total War games will love the chance to create new mods for this game as well. 

Soon, there will be mod tools available and the amount of potentially amazing mods will be there for all who bought this game the chance to really play their own style.

We've just reached a new level of gameplay regarding this part of the game. The gameplay in battle mode still needs work to be done. Warhammer is better in that sense. Variety of unit is an obvious concern. You have sword-spear-arrow-cav (and other types but it's pretty much a rock paper scissor thing). Warhammer had made an amazing improvement on that. Three kingdoms is still very fun with the leaders. 

The story you can build yourself is amazing. If you want the best experience ever. Just play multiplayer campaign with someone. Have your friend play as the A.I and your battles will be truly epic. 

The best part of the game is by far the story telling you build yourself. Events that will effect any expectation and you have a truly good rpg feeling. Here's a quick summary of about 50 turns in a campaign with a friend of mine who I used to play warhammer 1 online with. 

By far my best experience with the game so far. I've been playing head to head with a friend of mine I met on warhammer 1. 

I'm playing dong Zhuo faction and he's playing Gongsun Zan. 

Initially, I've been doing well. YUan Shu starts fucking me up from the east and the yellow turban does the same in the west. I suffer a crushing defeat due to freaking OP towers against Yuan Shu. 

Interesting points for my side : 
- dong Zhuo dies to lu bu. Diao Chan joins my faction but she's in bad term with Lu bu as they both are given position of power and Lu bu is not someone nice to work with in an administration. Diao chan hated Lu bu. She died in the crushing defeat by Yuan Shu. 

- Due to a civil war exploding very early. Zhang Liao, best friend of Lu Bu has to be executed before he revolt. It broke my hearth. But it was for the best of the realm. I don't know if he survived the execution. I never saw him but it made Lu Bu very unsatisfied. 

- Once dong Zhuo died, Dong Min, his Heir, took the throne. A parody of a man. A weakling. 

- a yellow turban rebellion spawned in the north of the capital. I did a bargain, if Dong Min won the duel against the rebel leader, he would be allowed to lead. The fight went very one sided against a yellow turban peasant with a spear who defeated Dong Min and killed him.

- Lu Bu became leader once Dong Min died and since then, Lu Bu personally crushed the western yellow turban faction. 

- Ma Teng went rogue, my only friend. He was defeated By Lu Bu's Might. I am now in full control of the north west. 

- Lu Bu reputation is almost to 0. Meaning he's less and less seen as treacherous. 

My friend as Gongsun Zan. 
- The western Coallition is massive. The entire north east is my enemy. My friend is having issues with the coalition after he won against Yuan Shao and proceeded to execute the false emperor. Everyone in the coalition declared war against him in the following turns.

- We always play as A.I whenever it's a fair battle. We delegate any big battles that we win easily. 

- He started very poor. Not facing much threat until Yuan Shao declared war on him out of nowhere. Probably because he wasnt part of his coalition. He was defeated by a massive battle that Yuan Shao was predicted to win but lost and was executed. 

- since then, Gongsun Zan was forced to give away cities to different coalition member who approached him with numerous full stacks. He's forced back into the mountain in the extreme north east of China. He has no ally except for one (the extreme north eastern faction above his starting position). He can't seem to take advantage back. They all hate him for executing Yuan Shao. After relinquishing most of the taken cities and fortifying his position, he's finally finding peace by creating a defensive barrier against his many enemies.",1558836610,1558836610,True,0.5454545617103577,True,False,False,702,en

The campaign depth in TWTK is really impressive and quite surprising for TW as I've felt like CA have tried to dumb things down in the past (ironically it's Paradox that has done this with their latest release). 
The battles look great and again surprised me. The preview videos didn't impress me at all as the battles seemed too bright and cartoon/mobile game like. But once I got the game into my hands, set the unit scale to extreme, removed arrow trails and changed the colour profile to ""records"" instead of ""romance"" I loved them.
Pros:
- campaign depth, many decisions to make.
- AI doesn't spam armies (from what I've experienced so far)
- Artstyle and graphics. They haven't gone crazy with the artstyle and its grounded in history which I love. No bulky Warcraft armour here :) 
- character interaction.
- seems quite optimized.
- loading screens are very brief (I'm using SSD) and have audio and visual narration which makes them less of a chore.
- lots of options to change the game and UI to your preferences. 
- Great tutorials. F1 highlights all buttons on the screen and explains them making it very easy to understand everything 

Cons:
- Battles are far to quick for my taste. Mods will address this.
- Not a huge fan of having 3 retinues in an army but I understand why they have them as it's much more character based than previous titles.

Fast forward a decade and some change and we have just that. Total War Three Kingdoms feels like a love letter to those who have been asking for features in Total War for years. Diplomacy and trade have never been deeper. Character driven relationships and politics dictate how the game is played and the AI plays like shrewd chinese warlords and backstabbing arrogant lords all the same. Every war brings a slew of different challenges in the most unexpected ways.

The combat needs some work, mostly in the unit variety department. We've been spoiled by the well-developed Warhammer 2 in that regard but given time and proper DLC's, I can see this game being the same way. As it stands, romance mode completely trumps records mode. 

Aside from a few key characters having generic models (a thing Koei is still suffering from 11 games deep) this game shows love to characters who often are overlooked. Characters like Ma Teng, Kong Rong, Yuan Shu and many more feel like they can hold their own. Having beaten the campaign as Liu Bei, I am glad to say that he is well-rounded as a legendary lord compared to his ROTK self that can barely fight given the chance.

The battles are okay. You get melee infantry, archers, cavalry and trebuchets, standard fare in many Total War games and pretty boring compared to the monsters and magic of Total War: Warhammer 1 & 2.

BUT, the campaign mechanics blow every other Total War game out of the water. It has the most deep and complex character system in the entire franchise. Your characters being friends or enemies with the characters in the other factions (especially faction leaders) will decide whether your campaign is exciting and victorious, or frustrating and short. In my Sun Jian campaign, Sun Jian's and Cao Cao's friendship made them stay firm allies until the endgame kicked off and Cao Cao became one of my rivals for the right to be the true emperor of China.

Another highlight is the Spy system. I had two spies in my Sun Jian campaign, one in Yuan Shu's kingdom and another in Yuan Shao's, and they both wreaked wonderful chaos discrediting characters in the courts of the Yuan brothers and driving them away to seek better fortunes in my kingdom. It takes a long time for a character to be adopted into a ruling family, but if they are they can start killing the other members of the family until they're chosen as the faction heir, where they can hasten the 'retirement' of their adopted father and potentially hand over the kingdom to you. That, or they go rogue and establish their own kingdom. It didn't happen in my campaign, but I'll absolutely try to make it happen in my next one.

So before I ramble on for a couple more paragraphs I'll do a TL;DR - this is a fracking awesome game!",1558829639,1558829639,True,0.0,False,False,False,306,en

First of all the ugly stuff : 

1: The i dont like the UI , but its not that i will not get used to it.Its mostly has to do with how units and officers work.Although i like their approach the aesthetic of the Ui and the whole recruitment of specific units to specific kind of generals is mehh.Maybe its because i havent yet fully understand how it works but it works i just started creating armies with specialised officers and i dont know it feels good.

2:Even though the game has both Romance and Records campaigns i feel like the battles are designed more for the Romance.I like playing Records Generals that specialize in combat are just OP , crazy op like taking down other characters crazy fast  and cavalry charge against any unit is devestating.In my cao cao campaign the general you start with (dont remember his name) every huge battle rack up to 1k kills.

3:The ai is bad same strategies all over again,archers unprotected although they try to flank they leave important units unguarded even if they have crazy huge numbers.I played a battle against yellow turbans me having ~3500 vd ~6000.Many archers i released cavalry in their back line and just farmed them.No protection at all even though for every 1 unit of mine he had 2.

4:Cavalry is Crazy OP.I feel they overtuned the charges but i feel like cavalry is really op i realised that in the battle i mentioned above.Yes most can say its about archers and its deffinetly a factor but charging head first into spear units and annihating them?  meeh

5:Tech tree is as poor as it can get.No work done here the same tree since shogun2 exist here.

These are the ugly stuff to me at least, i might find more the more i play who knows :P

The things i love

1: Unit size 240 per unit.YES!! I cant emphasize how important this is maybe next game we can push it up to 320-380.We need to praise CA alot for this just because we like it a lot.

2:The graphics are beutifull, i dont like the romance but i love the records a lot.It gives you the Attila vibe which is the best total war game in terms of atmosphere.

3:Diplomacy.I cant emphasize enaugh.Many many many options , all of them are usefull.There are so many ways to trade with others, trade food,weapons,armors,followers engage in weddings instigate proxy wars(which work perfectly),There are litterally so many options that i dont remember all of them and the AI is actively doing diplomacy not only asking for trade agreement or non agretion pact but accually seeking to trade your items, your food anything that has a value and you can do the same.

Politics and the smart use of diplomacy in this game is absolutely vital if you want to servive.There is no i can do it alone , certain Lords have specific traits that make others to become vassals very easy and fast .If you want to survive you need strong allies and always having a close eye on your enemies.

4: City development: From warhammer to Attila i would say city development is both of them.In Attila you have more complicated building system that relies on having combo of buildings.For example having industry buildings allong side with bonus increase of industry income.In warhammer you have very streamlined buildings that its as simple as it can get. In 3K  you have the main city allong 2-3 small specialised areas either of mines or horses or food or whatever.These specialised areas are streamlined but main cities are more like attila.You need to have combos of buildings.But thats not it.The income you generate from these buildings is not nearly enaugh if you leave it there.You need to have the right commander or in the right position to have the biggest income possible.

5:Characters are the centric theme of 3k. They are really important and now they have likes and dislikes.They can form bonds or hate each other.The rank up works similar to shogun2 or attila but the good thing is that the Random Trait system from older tw games is back although not in the same scale as them.You need to have generals that like each other to avoid dislikes or in worst case scenario a difection.

TL:DR there are so many new things in this game i really just realised i cant list all of them without typing 5 hours.If you enjoyed games like Attila,shogun2,warhammer1-2 you're gonna like this.If you didnt you might enjoy the diplomacy and all the new features which is a very nice change of Pace. Peace <3

Bit of a shocker if you're coming straight from TW:WH though as the interface and mechanics differ quite a lot. The diplomacy feels much more fleshed out and I feel like I actually have options, and the character/court system with assignments and persistent retinues makes me feel like I'm actually doing something that approaches managing a dynasty. Missions are helpful and give you the occasional significant choice.
Info buttons abound so the interface doesn't remain obscure for long, but it is rather clunky in areas. Graphically the depth blur can get a bit much but when it works it's beautiful, colourful without being overly cartoony, both in campaign and battle. The soundtrack sits in the background and does it's job well, calming you as you plot your rise to the seat of emperor. Voice acting is a bit... eh but the sound design can also be beautiful, with rain fading away to a muted patter if you zoom out on the map and taunts flying during battle.

With only a few armies and battles under my belt, my commentary there is limited. AI isn't much smarter than Total War AI ever is, and enemy armies are abysmal at protecting vital units or flanking. Battles can be over as quickly as TW:WH but the pacing feels more deliberate, allowing you to manage a number of units without typically feeling overwhelmed. The unit variety in terms of type and tier seems suitably specialised to different factions (and lords?) but I've focused my early reforms (research) into agriculture and commerce so I'm mostly low tier units right now.

Overall TL;DR: Pretty, decent middle ground between fantasy and history TW in the Romance mode, good campaign so far, battles are fun but AI is a bit dumb, food makes good political fodder (heh). Would recommend.",1558818913,1558818913,True,0.0,True,False,False,325,en

I personally play on romance mode, even after experimenting with records during the ""empire building stage"" 
Both are fun, but I find Romance to be a good balance of Realism and over the top. Fatigue plays a role either way.
This is a must have if you're a veteran of Total war and a perfect time to get into it, if you're on the fence of buying it or not.
I Like lists:

-Lots of customization options per character, as well mix and matching your retinue to be under the right commander etc.
-Even having an older built rig; this game runs very smoothly. MY GOD THE END TURN TIMES ARE much faster than I was expecting.
-When factions are destroyed, you're able to ""pick up"" the legendary characters by chance. Adding much more flavor.
- I'll call it the ""chemistry system"" Makes your armies able to clinch that Heroic Victory for you, since they are performing at their best!
-Able to build power house provinces, for your military, industry, commerce, population.
-ASSIGNMENTS!!!!! (Buff's from certain individuals) Getting sent to those provinces.
-AI isn't perfect, but they will try to counter engage, as well get to the flank, kill your missile infantry. Not much stacking I am at least experiencing, but it happens.

Two gripes I have with this game (excluding blood and gore), is the AI's performance in defensive battles. At least in my experience, the AI is very inconsistent on when it chooses to full on engage or just stand in place.
Secondly, Dueling. Once you reach level 4ish or higher. Duels become rare. (AI will refuse to duel) Since you can mainly beat anyone 1v1. Makes sense, but its a shame when you want to duel an iconic character.

As the majority of others stated: 
Diplomacy is beautifully hashed out
Espionage is such a welcomed mechanic
The amount of variety play styles and ""characters"" you can play as.
This is a very refreshing game to its predecessors.

Game has its flaws, but clearly things that can be patched. Eagerly waiting for the future content.

P.S. One tip I suggest for many of you. Disbanding Retinues is quite common, and watching your economy is SUPER CRITICAL. Can no longer build recklessly. Which I enjoy, but I know some of you won't.",1558805872,1558807112,True,0.0,True,False,False,413,en

Great stuff:
+ New diplomatic options.
+ More in depth empire building.
+ Armies being broken down into retinues that you can swap around a dispatch.
+ Better character customization and visable changes to their model from items.
+ Without a doubt the most stable release in TW history, not just that. It's beyond just a ""playable"" state. It's clean.

Good stuff:
+ New mechanics in how to win the campaign, rather than just: conquer, earn money and illiminate factions
     - Though it can seem a bit messy until you understand it.
+ Character being categorized by color (role) with great potential for role playing.
     - The color of a character is determined at birth, but not by you.
+ Stunning graphics and good optimization.
     - On lower graphics it can stand out as looking worse than other TW games on lower settings, in comparison.
+ The game has an all new ""format"" and mechanics that stands out from earlier TW games, whick is refreshing.
     - Steep learning curve in comparison to older titles.

Neutral stuff (up to interpretation and my own opinion):
+- The majority of the playable factions are clustered on the top half of the map, while to lower half is dominated by the disintegrating Han empire (that is up for grabs), ruined settlements, and few actual factions.
+- Much like Shogun 2 it has a low unit diversity between factions, though almost all has a handful of unique units. This makes battles between armies of similar compositions common, but the armies can have completly different strengths due to commanders and faction buffs.
+- The AI is a bit too keen on using that diplomacy button, while this is great in comparison to older games, it almost becomes a bit spammy. The AI will declare war on you from across the map and spend 20 turns sending you peace deals that includes enforcing your vassalage. 

Bad stuff:
- AI still getting massive buffs on the campaign map, though this is hard to compensate for.

All in all a great game, after ~30 hours i can't stop playing.

It even offers a more realistic total war experience that goes away from utilizing the various badass heroes for those who prefer a more traditional total war experience.

It's a bit tough at first and the building management is much more varied than previous titles.  Appointing Administrators was confusing at first as the game doesn't warn you when they aren't assigned so if you don't know where to look you just miss out.  Overall I'd give the UI an 8/10 as I still figured it out without googling.

The overhauls to domestic, espionage, diplomacy, technology and characters does make running an empire that much interesting, rather then the typical method of building highest cash yielding structures. For the first time in total war iv bothered to remember some of the nobles names in my realm to avoid unhappiness and poor court placement.

Battles are the weakest link in the game and feel like a downgrade from warhammer version. Granted it's a fantasy realm and this isn't. On records mode equipping new weapons, armor and horses to your generals feel like pointless effort, but probably different in romance mode (overpowered generals mode). Not to mention you can do classic cheesing of AI and absolutely annihilate them with overpowered catapults, while AI uses soviet russias tactics to throw everything at you all disorganized.

There is also army mustering now, which is nice complexity but made in very simple manner. Each general can hold 6 units under command. You buy the initial units to form a set you want if you're financially crippled or don't need it anymore you can simply send the army to reserves and can be brought back for a price pending what kind of units they have, but take several turns to muster to full strength (Armies can contain 3 generals max, but can be reinforced by adjacent armies).

The depth to campaign might seem discouraging at first, but it’s nowhere near the frustrating complexity of a Paradox game. It strikes a good balance between being just deep enough to be interesting and require thought to your actions, but also easy enough to understand that you’ll have gotten the hang of it after your first campaign.
The overhaul to diplomacy is a long time coming for the series and makes diplomacy a delightfully intricate, valuable, and important part of your campaigns, rather than being the arbitrary, nonsensical cluster-fuck that it’s been in every game since Shogun 2.

Battles are where the game starts to falter however. Many of the complaints I’ve read is that battles don’t have the variety and spectacle of Warhammer, which is true, but not the real problem. The unit roster will be expanded with free content and DLC, and the spectacle… well, the “spectacle” depends on your tastes; do you prefer LotR-style fantasy battles with monsters and magic? Or the Hollywood blockbuster war movies of Red Cliff, Gladiator, and Saving Private Ryan? Three Kingdoms is the “Hollywood Blockbuster” type of spectacle.

The big problem with battles right now is the role of characters.
In Romance mode characters are single units like in Warhammer, capable of great feats and taking on hundreds of enemies. But depending on their class, you’ll either rely on them too much to tank the entire enemy frontline, or they’ll be stuck in the back and forgotten about. Duels (while visually fantastic) also seem a bit like a gimmicky mini-game with no real impact on the rest of the battle.
In Records mode, your characters act more like generals in previous games and are accompanied by a bodyguard unit. The problem is, there’s very little variation between them in Records mode, and they mostly just act as an additional cavalry unit in your army. Skill trees in Records mode are very lacklustre too and need a big overhaul to make them more impactful.

However, seeing as how the game only just launched, I’m confident these shortcomings will be overcome and the battles will be improved to be great fun. All in all, an absolutely fantastic and enjoyable game. Highly recommend it.

Notable mention: the game runs smoother than melted butter. It's the most well-optimised Total War game I've ever played. I'm running it on an i7-7700k, GTX 1070 GPU, 1440p monitor, all ultra settings and extreme unit sizes, and the thing hardly drops a frame even when I zoom right into the carnage.

Well, at Rome 2, if you fight a force march army, they will force to fight a ambush battle which I consider as best counter to the bonus of force march. At Three Kingdom, the force marched army can retreat if they met any battle. Yes, you can never ever catch any force matched army since they move a further range, and retreat form any force trying to catch their tail. I have spent at least 10 turn and 2 forces to trace down the enemy when they finally reach till the end of the map. (thanks god they do have a limit on the size of the board).

Secondly, in Three Kingdom, you could actually move from one side of the rive to another within one turn move(through the shipping) Well, I have no idea why that river excite.

[b]Characters[/b]
The character system has been massively revamped to something like a Crusader Kings-lite system. It works. Every character has their own ""satisfaction"" rating, and can develop relationships (positive and negative) with the others that they encounter. Every character has a class, and they can all be assigned in any capacity you like (generals, administrators, spies etc).

Furthermore, in ""Romance"" mode, characters are something akin to the Warhammer lords and heroes - individual, extremely powerful units, which I love (though you can choose to play on ""Records"" mode if that isnt your jam).

Also, there is an entirely reasonable system of equipment of different rarities etc. And I love that when you equip your general with say - a glaive, they will actually use that in the battles.

[b]Army Composition[/b]
Each army consists of up to 3 characters, and each character has their own retinue of up to 6 regular units. Many of the buffs characters receive will only apply to their retinue, not the whole army, so it makes sense to specialise; having a cavalry commander hitting the enemy flanks with his units, whilst your ""strategist"" sits at the back with the archers and artillery. Again, it works.

[b]Diplomacy[/b]
Diplomacy has received a long overdue overhaul, and is far better than in previous TW games. It appears CA have borrowed some of the best elements of the Paradox games - you can now see exactly what ""value"" the other party puts on each element of any proposed deal, and a breakdown of why they feel that way. The availability of information makes diplomacy much more flexible and enjoyable than previous games.

[b]Optimisation[/b]
A less glamorous point perhaps, but imagine my amazement when I hit the ""End Turn"" button, and within seconds I was back on my next turn. The game runs far better than a lot of previous ones have done at launch. Loading times and turn times are quick, I have yet to encounter a single bug. Its just generally a very polished game - kudos to CA.

I love that there are two different modes so theres something for everyone depending on what you are looking for. Romance places heavier emphasis on your generals and dueling, vs records being your more classic total war

Spy mechanic has been totally revamped, no needing to keep track of your 16 agents, instead through tech/rank you unlock spy slots to have an officer try to infiltrate another faction, where they have numerous options depending on where they get placed there

to me the biggest downside is there's a bit less unit diversity than I would like, but it doesn't break the game for me

Now let's just give some context to just how good this game is. 

-Immersive game world
-rich narative driven historical setting
-based on one of the oldest novels ever
-it's actually fucking well optimised. A total war game that's well optimised. Never thought i'd see the day.
-It looks good, and it knows where to cut corners to make it run well. 
-this is the first tw game to launch with an above 70% score since shogun 2
-you can send three dudes in to kill everyone
-you can play like a normal total war game with a general leading an army.
-you can play with a new mode that makes your characters superhuman as if they were from the romance novels. 
-I love this game, and i loved rome 2 at launch, hell i've got 1400 hours in that damn hellhole bugs and all. 
-no landship bug. 

now for some problems because nothing is perfect. 

-pathing can be a bit iffy.
-i miss matched combat.
-the economy system can feel a bit harsh sometimes.
-it still suffers the old alt+tab bugs of yestergames 
-it doesn't take much for a warlord to steamroll over other ai. 

honestly i want to have more negative to say else this feels too biased, but i genuinely cannot find too many faults in this game. I love it and i'm not even the biggest fan of CA's newer TW titles. Thrones and both warhammers were ok, but somehow they combined the two and made this masterpiece.

The only thing missing from this game that I wish was in is the agent units.  I miss those from Shogun 2 because those were a lot of fun to use to disrupt the other factions.  I'm currently playing as Cao Cao to get into the game a bit easier since they've changed SO MUCH.  The UI is completely different and diplomacy has been overhauled with a much needed update.  Hooray!  I'm so happy about that because you can make, join, or leave coalitions.  Speaking about the UI I'm really happy with how it looks now and how beautiful the artwork is.

Another thing I really love about this game is that you can have a ""Romance"" mode or a classic TW mode where generals have bodyguards.  The romance mod is like Warhammer where the generals are OP and can knock through basic units like freight trains.  The best thing that's been introduced to the combat is the duel system.  I've won a few battles with this feature and it definitely can turn the tide of a fight.  It can be nail bitingly nerve wracking because you don't want to lose your best generals or heroes.  

To sum up, this is the best Total War has been in a long time.  I like this game more than the Warhammer games and that's saying something because I loved those games to death!

A solid 9.5/10 for me.  The only flaw is the missing agent units.  If they added that in with a free dlc I'd be very happy.  It'd make the game a bit deeper but I'm fine without for now because of the epic machine this game is!",1558746081,1558746081,True,0.0,False,False,False,297,en

The first regime inherits the issue. Ca should change his mind. The history of the three countries in China is different from that of Japan and the West. The inheritance of direct relatives in China is far better than that of the first two, or it is better to inherit the inheritance of the adopted children. It is best to strictly follow the name of one country and one family. I hope that ca can improve the fertility rate of the generals, and don’t let the different surnames inherit the throne all day long.
第二关于人物起名问题。既然面向中国玩家 就要经得起考验。游戏里面不能再随便瞎起名字了至少重要的势力 有据可考的势力 别瞎起名字。比如魏国，历史上太祖武皇帝那么多儿子都有籍可靠 非得瞎编乱造。还瞎编一堆四字的女将名字更是恶心人。
Dzerzhinsky 2019-05-25 1:47:51
The second question about the name of the character. Since it is facing Chinese players, it will stand the test. In the game, you can't just pick up the name. At least the important force. The power of the testable. Don't pick up the name. For example, Wei Guo, in history, so many sons of the Taizu Wu emperor have a reliable reputation. It is also a disgusting person to edit a bunch of four-word women.
第三女将问题。曹操和老婆卞夫人并肩作战；吴国太率兵进攻魏国。这种设定是个中国人都会感到尴尬。女将可以取消了（虽然我知道不现实 但还是想多说几句） 像早期罗马2版本那样老实在家生孩子 偶尔参加一下内政不好吗？非得去前线打仗，严重违和.
Third, women will be the problem. Cao Cao and his wife-in-law fight side by side; Wu Guotai led the troops to attack Wei Guo. This kind of setting is a Chinese person will feel embarrassed. The woman will be able to cancel (although I know it is unrealistic, but I still want to say a few more words). As a child of the early Roman version 2, I have a child at home. Is it not good to participate in the internal affairs occasionally? Have to go to the front line to fight, seriously violated.
第四我个人非常喜欢全面战争系列 从罗马1开始 几乎全部系列全战我都玩过 入正了三部全战。我在这里提建议不是喷全战 而是希望三国全面战争能够在将来的版本中变得更有历史韵味更符合中国历史传统变得更受国人欢迎同时ca也能赚更多钱就看之后的版本更新了，有不同看法可以交流我讨厌上来就喷人的。
Fourth, I personally like the comprehensive war series. From Rome 1 I have played almost all the series of full battles. I am here to suggest that it is not a full-fledged war, but that the full-scale war of the Three Kingdoms will become more historical in the future version. It is more in line with the Chinese historical tradition and has become more popular with the Chinese and ca can also make more money. The version is updated, there are different opinions, I can exchange, I hate to spray on people.",1558743149,1558764273,True,0.523809552192688,False,False,False,377,en

Turn 1: Defeat rebels.
Turn 2: Use the money in my coffers to expand my army to deal with the Han and Yellow Turbans.
Turn 5: Okay, the siege of some of these towns are taking longer than I thought, waiting it out shouldn't hurt!
Turn 7: Liu Bei's power has grown, he has signed a trade agreement with me as well as many deals in my favour.
Turn 10: Liu Bei's vastly superior army is crushing my Han opponents to the East of my small cluster of settlements, good!
Turn 15: Okay, money is shrivelling up a bit, I haven't encountered enough factions to really benefit from Kong Rong's 
              trading perks and whilst food is not an issue because of the fishing ports and farms I prioritised taking at the start 
              of the campaign, commerce is failing due to having only 1 trading port. Good thing Liu Bei always gives me good 
              deals.
Turn 30: My economy is really struggling, I still have only farms and fishing ports, Liu Bei has taken all of the territories 
               around me meaning that I can't expand, Kong Rong is not supposed to be warlike therefore having many armies 
               isn't good, therefore I only have my small army consisting of Kong Rong, one Sentinal and one commander, I have 
               no hope of taking on the might of Liu Bei, and he won't give me military access unless I give him all of the money 
               I have as well as regular payments of the tiny amount I will make in the future.
Turn 42: Cao Cao has started up trading deals with me! Amazing! Finally I can stop relying on Liu Bei and finally get my 
               economy back on track!
Turn 50: Trading is thriving, my monopoly has grown massively and Liu Bei can now no longer offer me the crazy unfair 
              deals he peddled to me before But now I have two powerful allies! One in Cao Cao and one in Liu Bei, who is also 
              allied with Yuan Shao, this is great! My lands are surrounded by allies, my economy is booming, this is the 
              situation Kong Rong was made for!
Turn 60: Cao Cao has broken treaties with me, he is becoming increasingly hostile towards my lands due to the lack of 
              military capability, at least I have Liu Bei as a buffer against him.
Turn 74: Cao Cao has declared war upon me and Liu Bei, finally a chance to gain some land and increase my coffers!
Turn 80: Liu Bei has torn through Cao Cao's initial forces, giving way for my smaller force to pick at the scraps and gain 
              easy land!
Turn 81: Cao Cao has convinced Liu Bei to turn against me..... Oh f***...
Turn 83: The 2 giants come crashing down on me, Yuan Shao joining the melee as the hounds fall upon the limping gazelle.
Turn 84: I am fighting desperately to hold my final settlement, my capital, I will not let it fall!

  It has done such a good job with the campaign side of the game this time round, From the relationships within your faction to the Underground Spy network and everything in between just seems to flow smoothly. It can be a bit overwhelming at first even for non new to the series players but they have added a lot to the game in terms of help. F1 will bring up an in depth over view of your UI and allow you to cursor over any part and it gives a very in depth explanation to each one. 

  The siege battles are also done really well, though can take a bit longer than other release in the series if you plan on having Ultra or Extreme Unit Sizes. For the Rome 2 fans I may be mistaken but there is no first person mode for the Siege Defensive's but there are more than just the Guard Towers, The addition of  the Trebuchet  to the defensive side of things which was not in WH2 or TOB is great. The fire arrows while on the other side of the wall also add a really nice effect when they start to burn down half the buildings if fires catch.

  Performance wise - I run on a I7-8700 and GTX 1060, on 1080p I get 60 fps constantly after using Rock, Paper Shotguns article to adjust some of the Advanced Settings. If you plan on running the benchmark while adjust make sure you click accept/confirm prior to testing it or it will revert to the previous settings you had saved last.

  I would give a number out of 10 but I don't generally review games, I guess the hype train which was TotalWarOfficial (Wheels & Tom) on Twitch really got me excited for the game and with the company being one of the first I have seen to push a game and really listen the feedback from the testing stages (Closed Alpha Etc.) to implement changes for the better as opposed to meeting a set date due to Estimated Quotas is a refreshing site in the gaming world.

  I would highly recommend this game not only to returning fans of the series but also others who are thinking of getting into Total War, You won't regret it.

⚔️ ARMIES ⚔️

- Huge changes - No more doom stacks
- Armies require a general and 2 captains to reach ""full stack"" size
- Each general and captain can recruit 6 units into their retinue each.

( I was slightly confused about how to get upgraded or advanced military units for a while 'til I figured it out. Reading below will help clear up any confusion for someone new to the game )

- All factions have access to the same militia units (sabre, spear, archer, and a few cav)
- Other specific types of units can be recruited based on their CLASS and FACTION. 
- The CLASSES are Strategist, Commander, Vanguard, Sentinel, Champion
- So for instance if you want Heavy Spearguard in your army, you better have a rank 6 Champion as either the army's general or one of it's 2 champions.   If you want trebs to knock down walls you need to have a strategist. 
- More advanced, class-specific units are unlocked via reforms (this game's version of a tech tree)
- So for example, you want to recruit Repeater Crossbowmen, you need to have a Strategist in your army and have the Liu Bo reform enacted. 

This layered tech - class - faction army approach is refreshing. No more rushing tech and making doom stacks for pointless roflcopter speed-runs. You'll actually have to rely on militia quite heavily in the early game. 

====================================================================================================

⛰️ Graphics ⛰️ (My VC is a Sapphire Vega 64 with EVERYTHING set on Ultra) 
- The campaign map has seen a major overhaul. It definitely has a CIVILIZATION VI feel to it and you can tell the fog of war effect was heavily inspired by that game. Obviously it's far more detailed than Civ6 but it has some strong similarities. 
- Better optimized than previous TW titles, on both campaign and battle maps.
- BATTLE MAP Performance is overall better but the detail seems somewhat less (as in, more cartoony) than WH1 & 2. Overall combat looks more like Attila combat than it does WH. To me this is slightly disappointing but for the sake of optimization I can see why they did it. 

====================================================================================================

🏡 Provinces 🏡
- Now called Commanderies 
- Minor Settlements Are Specialized - meaning you can only advance/upgrade the building tree that is already present (just like Thrones of Britannia). Lumber yard, Fishing Port, Livestock Farm, Farmland, Trade Port, etc.etc.etc. 
- Minor Settlements have garrisons again! (curse you, Thrones of Britannia!!) The more upgraded the settlement, the more units will be garrisoned there. 
- Population Growth management is now a major part of your campaign strategy. A large portion of your income derives from Peansantry income and the more peasants you have, the more income you acquire. Also, since army recruitment works very similar to the way it does in ToB where units are recruited with small numbers and take several turns to muster, the higher your local population the faster your retinues will muster / replenish.
- Food management works like it does in Thrones of Britannia - always be on the plus side of this and you'll be fine. 

====================================================================================================

🛠️ Ancillaries 🛠️
- Your faction leader and each member of your court (family members, generals, and candidates that you can hire), have the ability to ""equip"" a weapon, an armor piece, a horse, a follower, and an item.
- Each equipped item or follower gives specific stats and in some cases, abilities. 

====================================================================================================

🤑Trade🤑
- You can initiate trade agreements which let you pay gold-per-turn for outcomes, just like in CIVILIZATION. 
- You can trade for ancillaries which is a new twist that I really like. 
- Trade agreements are very important for your income and can't be thought of as an after-thought like in other TW titles. 
- You can also gift or trade territories...something that should have been a part of every total war game. 
- Food-per-turn can be traded and is a major bargaining chip if you have a surplus! And of course you can also offer trades to gain food from other factions if you need it. 

====================================================================================================

😎 Spies 😎
You can hire spies and send them into other territories to gather intel on their inner workings. Similar to CIVILIZATION, except not for the intent of stealing a technology. 

====================================================================================================

🤝 Diplomacy 🤝
HOLY CRAP this is where things get really interesting with THREE KINGDOMS and outside of the graphics this might be the biggest change over all previous TW games. 
A quick glance at the ""Quick Deal"" tab gives you the following options (some disabled based on the situation of course):

- PEACE - NON AGGRESSION PACT - MILITARY ACCESS - BECOME VASSAL - OFFER SUBSERVIENCE - SUPPORT VASSAL INDEPENDENCE - CREATE VASSAL - DEMAND ABDICATION - DEMAND AUTONOMY - CONFEDERATE - TRADE AGREEMENT - FORM COALITION - DEMAND SUBMISSION - SUBMIT TO THE CAUSE 

And those are just the QUICK DEALS you can make with another faction! 

-There's also several things you can negotiate including joining a faction via marriage (which ends the game for you... lol) or offering to have another faction join your's through marriage. 
- Cao Cao can also create wars between factions (called Proxy Wars) by spending Credibility points. It's kinda how the High Elves in WH2 could use Influence.",1558734718,1558735394,True,0.0,True,False,False,895,en

Total war Three Kingdoms is in my opinion the most ambitious total war to date. CA has put a lot of effort in new mechanics and gameplay tweaks and it has worked wonders. there are more diplomatic options available and after 14 hours I still have a few options that I have still to discover how it really works. Trade and population mechanics have been improved as well. 

Managing your empire has never been such a delight. 

The real time battles are the same rock paper scissors that is a staple of Total war. If you like previous real time battles you will like them here as well. Romance mode gives the battles some flair and style by giving you the options to dual other officers which then will fight against each other in a brutal fashion. 

I have not touched multiplayer yet (waiting for friends to buy this masterpiece) so I will update review when I have played it. 

Graphics are amazing and the game runs really well/ in my 14 hours I have only encountered two small bugs where when returning from slow motion to normal speed units still moved in slow motion and a small graphical glitch but these were not game breaking and not a big deal. 

 This is one of the best total war games to date!

Battle are this. Send your hero’s in and let them kill most of the army then send your army to finish them. Sometimes other nobles don’t want to fight you.

 Graphic 9.5 for graphics I am running only a 970 ti and the graphics look great and I have had no problems with extreme unit sizes. 
Campaign game play  if judging on all other total wars it is the best of them all but I can give it 9.8. Battle game 9 play this is what I here a lot on other reviews complaining about no big changes. I think the whole romance mode with dueling is a big change and I really like it it allows you to get more invested in your general.
 Besieging battle  game play I will give this an 8.7 I know that a lot of guys think the towers are op but I think it makes it more realistic since normally a besieging force would need to be double the strength to take a fortified position specially if towers where evolved and their is a good counter balance when you are defender you can actually use choke points and the towers to your advantage with a lot less men.

The Battle of Jianye, Autumn 196

From a hidden place deep in the forest Zhang Fei watched his brother fight a bloody war. Arrows fell like rain atop men and horse alike while the air filled with sounds of clashing steel and screaming beasts and men. Zhang ground his teeth in frustration. Reinforcements were coming to aid the enemy and he intended to cut them down before they dropped arrows atop his friends, so for now all he could do was wait and watch those he loved most fight without him.

Liu Bei fought in front of his column of soldiers where he might meet the strongest of the opposing forces before they could reach his men. In the midst of the battle Bei sat tall atop his steed like a giant oak in a field of weeds. His weapons hummed through the air in a blur as man after man fell before him. Many offers for duels had already been offered by Liu Bei to any brave enough to meet him in combat, but the cowardly generals hid and were content to send hundreds of their followers to death instead.

As battle waged on dead from both sides began to number in the hundreds. Sweat streamed down Liu Bei’s face and several small cuts and wounds had darkened his clothing crimson. Zhang could see despite his brother’s might his speed had begun to slow. Enemies he would easily have cut asunder before fought back with increasing strength.

Squinting into the distance Zhang Fei could see the reinforcements he was to ambush were still a good distance away. It was too early to break cover. He yearned to join the fray and stand with his brother but knew they would both die to arrow fire if the approaching archers were left unchallenged. Still, he watched on with growing concern as strength and speed slowly sapped from Liu Bei’s form. Even the strongest of trees eventually give way and break if enough men hang from their branches. Suddenly, a load voice rose broke Zhang Fei’s musings as it rose in challenge from the enemy ranks.

A purple cloak flapped in the wind behind a sauntering figure Zhang recognized to be Liu Yao. Sunlight glinted brightly from a spotless blade Yao held above his head as he urged his horse forward. Even from a distance Zhang Fei could see that a smile played upon the arrogant man’s lips. He too must see that his brother was fatigued and hoped to claim a great prize this day! But, before Zhang could react and rush forth and meet the challenge instead, Liu Bei answered. With a slight nod shaking arms raised two blood-soaked blades to accept the duel. “Damn!!” Zhang Fei swore as he watched the villain Liu Yao gallop toward his brother.

“You should never have come here!” Yao roared as Bei’s blades rose to block the opening attack.

“Wrong.” Liu Bei answered simply. “I am a river of change cleansing corruption from China.” Liu Yao’s eyes widened in shock as fatigue began to leave Liu Bei’s form while he spoke. “And, you are but a stone destined to be washed beneath its tide.” With great speed and agility Bei’s blades then flashed through the air. Across the distance separating him from the duel Zhang Fei could hear Liu Yao scream in pain. His brother drew first blood.",1558730521,1558730521,True,0.0,True,False,False,586,en

AI seems to make logical and ""wise"" decisions about it's potential relationships, you no longer fear your allies turning on you without warning because it suites the AI progression to victory ignoring previous relationship states.

The maps of both the tactical and strategic views are beautifully rendered and really immerse you in the lands you're fighting for. 

An in-depth subterfuge system allows for a much more involved set of misdeeds to perform on your enemies...or allies, without the blandness of character move and do action X.

Including the Hero system style from the TW: Warhammer games brings about a nice RPG feel to your characters, creating a deeper bond than that of the previous non-warhammer TW games where it was simple skill progression. But the beauty really lies in your choice of Romance or Standard gameplay styles, with Romance focusing and buffing the character to create a more story driven experience. Versus the standard strategic style which focuses on army tactics and...well...strategy, more than using your OP characters to break through enemy lines and then wash through them with your trailing army. Having both available is just a great addition, not much appreciated until you need to decide how you want to play. 

All in all, this is probably one of my favorite TW games and I am looking forward to seeing what they put into future expansions.

The campaign is much better then before by carrying over some features that Thrones of Britannia got right. Food is very important, your armies have supplies now which will run out if you have them on endless marches, if supplies run out you will face desertion. I also think the AI is a lot better in this campaign, I find it will try to gather its armies and will try and bait me more often. It just seems to make less stupid choices.

I play on records mode and have found the battles to be very enjoyable. The AI does not make too many stupid decisions, mostly. It did just randomly charge its right flank of cavalry at me ahead of its core which was quickly cut down by my whole army. This was only one time and it was quite funny to watch.

Performance wise the game is amazing. I have an I7 6700, GTX 1070 and 16 GB of DDR4 Ram. I play on Ultra settings. I get 60 fps constantly with no issues. The only time I every lost frames was during a huge battle with 4 armies but come on what do you expect, I did only drop down to 40 fps so it was still perfectly playable.

I still have it on CD ROM.  This game has been one of the biggest leaps in improvement in a long time.  The Diplomacy is deep but also easy to understand and learn.  In most Total War games you want to expand right away to get as economy and power as possible.  In this game you can actually bide your time and use diplomacy and secrecy to gain power.  It is fun, interactive, and immersive.  The heroes are fun but you can play without them being such a bonus.

All-in-all this game is very impressive and fun.  Moving it back two months to release was a great idea and I hope more gaming companies take this approach to making a great game delayed is more important than a rushed buggy game.  

If you like strategy, or just a game you can play while watching something on another screen.  This is the game for you.

I started the game as Lui Bei and immediately went looking for a new home.  I found a new home in a town called Langye.  I started pushing Northwest to conquer more territory and united with Tai Quan against Cao Cao.  As the war waged on Cao Cao was decimating Tai Quan's forces.

[olist]
[*] WARHAMMER 2:
[*] WARHAMMER 1:
[*] Napoleon
[/olist]

What Makes Three Kingdoms a Great Total War compared to other entries:
[list]
[*] Diplomacy means something, vassals, unification, coalitions, trading territory, items, food.
[*] Character Relations and character building feels similar to Crusader Kings 2, very good.
[*] Strategic Layer much more important than in previous titles
[*] Well optimized for a total war game. I crash constantly with Warhammer 2 but haven't once CTD'd with TK. There are some bugs however that require a restart however.
[*] Dueling system and heroes system is a revamped form of what we would see from Warhammer. 
[/list]

What makes Three Kingdoms a Bad Total War compared to other entries:
[list]
[*] Lack of diverse units; Warhammer has diverse set of units TK does not, it's like 2 unique units for each faction. (See below for additional point)
[*] [spoiler] sometimes dumb ai but like all total war games.... so forget this one [/spoiler] 
[*] User Interface slightly confusing when displaying information such as corruption and unit morale (though once you see it you'll remember where to look. It's just finding it can be annoying)
[/list]

Additional Information:
The lack of units in Total War Three Kingdoms ""can"" be justified if you consider the following, Free Company Militia, Swordsmen, Reiksguard Knights, & Karl Franz from Warhammer is a great unit for the Empire and an icon for what I would imagine as the Empire. We don't think much about Liu Bei's faction beyond just Liu Bei and of course his brothers. We don't think about Cao Cao's troops, we think about Cao Cao. In that sense, I understand where Creative Assembly comes from when doing this. The game is focused on the characters FAR more than it is on the units.

Conclusion:
Total War Three Kingdoms has many improvements from the previous titles that I sincerely hope the Fantasy Team copies when making Warhammer 3.

As a longtime Total War fan, I'm thrilled that we have a Total War title that has been released with very few launch issues. I've found a few bugs here and there, but what Total War game hasn't been released with a few bugs?

Bottom Line: This game is great. 8.5/10.

Innovations in diplomacy, characters, family trees, food and loyalty systems, supply trains for armies- all these add up to set this title as not just another Total War title, but a well thought out and polished release title. 

It feels kind of like Shogun 2 mixed with some Warhammer elements. The Romance mode makes your characters strong but not outrageously strong like your characters can become in Warhammer. Although I haven't played Lu Bu yet. 

Man, the music, art, and design of this game are great.

The battles feel good. You know what's weird? I normally reach a point in a Total War campaign where I just end up becoming bored and wanting to start another campaign. The diplomacy functions and coalitions in this game really keep me interested in the later game. 

I'm still playing this game, and I imagine I will be for a good while to come. 

The bad? A few bugs, a few diplomacy tweaks could be improved (my vassal gets attacked and me supporting them is treacherous because I recently declared peace with the faction that attacked them), but otherwise, I can't find much to complain about in this game. It's honestly a blast.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game. As a Total War fan who places Rome I and Shogun 2 (and FOTS) amongst my favorite titles, I encourage you to buy this game if the theme or setting appeals to you. I love ancient China, so I might be slightly biased.

If you're familiar with the Total War series, the basic components will be familiar for you: you have armies that you move around the map and use to fight/secure territory, you have territory that you manage, and you manage your wars/relations with other factions on the map.

What you may not be as familiar with is the overhauled diplomacy and Guanxi mechanic for characters in your faction.  There are plenty of reviews and materials that describe the mechanics of this game in detail, and how much more engaging the game becomes as a result.  What I can add is this: for the first time in a Total War game, managing the characters in your faction is an integral, satisfying part of gameplay that is organically connected to your overall economic and military development and serves as a key part of your overall strategy in a campaign.

Total War: Three Kingdoms captures the human drama of a ruling court  and the competing incentives of individuals better than any other Total War game, and even better than most strategy games, period.  In so doing, it transcends the ""Total War"" feeling: for once, diplomacy and management are as much fun in a total war game as the eponymous wars, and the game is richer for it.

That is not to say that war is undeveloped.  The battles and army system are refined from earlier titles.  Battles are intense, dynamic affairs with little unit diversity across factions, but with more than enough recruitment and in-battle maneuvering to make up for it.  Heroes are important (especially in Romance mode), but not nearly as powerful as in the Warhammer titles.  The battles play out much like in Shogun 2, but with seemingly larger battle maps and much more elaborate sieges.

There is much more I can say, but I will leave with this: Total War Three Kingdoms accomplishes the rare feat of living up to its own hype; it provides engaging battles while finally providing economic, political, and diplomatic management  to equal its battles.  I am certain that it is destined to be a classic not only of Total War but of the strategy genre.",1558717837,1558717837,True,0.0,True,False,False,379,en

For veterans of the total war franchise, they will recognize records modes as the more ""classic Total War"". General body guard units and less fantasy events. Personally I didn't even try this mode. I'm too busy enjoying the new Romance mode. Romance mode play toward the fantasy side of this period. Generals are their own unit capable of taking down whole units by themselves. Fantasy events and characters take place (Like Diao Chan and Lu Bu event). 

This total war have put much emphasis on the Campaign. The campaign is filled with the AI making alliances, coalitions, becoming vassals, arranging marriages, etc. I've been playing total war games since Total War: Rome and I've never seen the campaign AI this engage in trying to end war with diplomatic means. During my Sun Jian campaign, I had an enemy faction become a vassal to my allies to stop my invasion into their lands. In previous total wars the AI would have simply fought to the death without a consideration of becoming a vassal to keep their lands. 

Now with that being said on the battle map side of things, this is not the most varied total war out their. There not much difference in units that you'll use vs some other faction. If you played shogun 2 total  war, then this will be nothing new to you. But with the introduction of retinues, units won't have formation unless a strategist or retinue leader have a skill that enable that formation. This will take some getting used to for veteran total war players.

Honestly this is becoming one of my favorite total war. I've been waiting for CA to improve Campaign diplomacy. And the reduction of crazy units that warhammer introduced make it easier for me to find the uses out of the units. I've been waiting for a Dynasty Warriors & Total War cross over and this the best I will probably get.

Pros:

+I like the diversity of characters in the game.

+ The diplomacy is vastly improved compared to their previous titles and the spying and intrigue provides an additional fun aspect to game play. The character system is also a nice addition, with the ability to swap out equipment, and the focus on making sure your court remains loyal. I know some people had mentioned the ""boring"" character models of the troops but I believe they are perfectly accurate to the time period (This is not Warhammer). I also like the graphics and don't see the comparisons to a ""mobile game"". The performance is pretty good but CA should still seek to improve their engine because larger unit sizes are extremely strenuous even on high-end rigs.

+Ability to choose between romance or records graphics options.

+Voice acting is well-done, especially by the advisor. 

Cons:

Though I do like the inclusion of the duel system, it is often not used at higher levels because my champions scare any potential opponent. The combat as well can be tedious or easily predictable, oftentimes my archers just lay waste to the opponents who stand there and take it until they break. In many battles I never even utilize my melee or cavalry because the archers are sufficient enough. 

- Overall AI could use improvement, as well as cavalry charges which can be hit and miss. 

- As often as the AI utilizes the rivers, wisely might I add, it would have been nice to have smaller-scale naval battles.

-Needs some gore but I know that is coming soon.

Overall: 8/10

-battle ui is not great. Units are by default organized by retinue which is pointless but can be switched to unit type.

I completely absorbed myself into the story of 3 kingdoms, how people played their part in history and how to play along with that input- or averse myself from it. watching series, reading wiki pages and checking old development logs.

-Seems well optimized
-Turns end and begin within 5 - 10 seconds
-There seems to be quite a bit of depth, many buildings, technologies and even general items
- More than just one system within the game, a lot more fleshed out than Warhammer
- Reminds a lot of Shogun, not just in the setting, which is what everybody fucking wanted!
- Quite a few different factions to play from the beginning, and apparently a massive map (haven't explored all yet)
- The map itself looks and feels much better, cut through with mountains, small and larger rivers
- Military supply is added, which stops armies from having 40 year long endless conquering campaigns without ever stopping

The game has a lot of complexity to it compared to some past total war games. Lots more options in diplomacy, character choices, the UI is all a bit different and needs getting used to but overall it seems quite a fun game. There is also many settings to alter about the UI like unit cards, how the cards are arranged, arrow trails, the new drag units by depth rather than width feature and many more.

There are two modes to play the game on Romance or Records mode. After playing both for a couple hours now let me give my initial impressions:

Romance Mode:
In romance mode the battles are very short with a major focus on the characters. This doesn't really feel like playing your regular total war game but rather similar to DOTA where the game is decided not by the regular units ""creeps"" but rather the positioning and use of your characters as well as your timing of their abilities. In this mode the battles can be decided by things like whether your character wins or loses a duel with an enemy character. Expect most battles to be about 5 minutes, even siege battles.

Records Mode:
In this mode the game goes for a more historically accurate feel. The commanders are not lone characters but rather accompanied by a bodyguard unit, whose size is determined by some of the characters stats. The battles last around 10-15 minutes and are decided more by the positioning of your units and by flanking maneuvers. I quite like that champion ""melee"" characters lead their bodyguard units from the front ready to get into combat whilst strategist characters hide in the centre of their bodyguard trying to actively avoid combat. Fatigue also plays a much greater role in battles so probably turn auto run off if you want to maintain some stamina for the actual combat.

I think overall Creative Assembly has done a great job on Three Kingdoms, I think each person should give each mode a try and see which appeals to them more. If you are a more casual gamer or enjoy seeing heroes take on armies the romance mode is probably better suited to you. If you want a game that is closer to the original total war games, where unit positioning and timing of charges determines the victory give Records mode a go. Either way I think this game will have something that appeals to most players.",1558704607,1558704607,True,0.501915693283081,True,False,False,435,en

Is there any improvement from TW:WH2? Yes 
Graphic? Good
Gameplay mechanic? Good and Bad :
- Good because there is a lot of nice mechanic like the make this work in diplomacy, demand surrender in a siege, GENERAL DUELING, ""Realistic and Romatic"" modes and a lot more.
- Bad because..... well too many information at first.... like you need to pay attention to a lot of things and since a lot of these mechanics not in previous Total War... well some people will need adjustment.
Story? Good. Well, its Three Kingdoms.... FINALLY
Hardware demanding....? Hard to say my rig can run just fine but dunno for others tho
Worth your money? Yes, for me at least worth full price.

What can be improved?
Well, IDK if CA will read this but here's some of my rather small complaint...
- Give a dark/black theme for the menu. White for me is just eye tiring. But the menu looks great thoo 
- Make the character or army action range more visible.
- Give UI slider to all resolution. 
- Give more different color palettes to other faction. It's confusing sometimes
- Implement the ""at war"" icon like in TW:WH2 when clicking on a faction to see easier with who they are at war with
Note : despite these complaints, the game is still good and I love it,

Total War: THREE KINGDOMS is the latest installment of the Total War franchise. This time we go to China during the historic period of the 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms'.


[h1]Performance/Graphics[/h1]
[b]My PC specs are:[/b]
[list]
[*]GPU: RTX 2080
[*]CPU: Intel Core i7-8700k
[*]RAM: 16 GB
[/list]
The optimization of the game felt great and doesn't make my expensive rig feel like a huge sack of garbage like with previous Total War titles and I was very surprised to only see very minor graphical issues. I constantly ran the game at a stable 60+ FPS with very few exceptions such as experiencing some frame drops during custom battles (with big armies of course). I haven't noticed any frame drops during the Campaign Mode, but I haven't progressed very far yet. Visuals are beautiful and there's not really much to complain about. Might just be because of my expensive rig, but who knows?


[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Campaign:[/b]
Before starting the campaign you have to choose a lord. You have the option to choose between lords in the categories: Coalition, Governors, Outlaws, and Yellow Turbans [strike](which is a week one DLC btw, why are you doing this to us?)[/strike] There are a total of 14 characters to choose from, very nice :)
[b]You are also able to choose between a 'Romance' or 'Records' campaign:[/b]
[b]Romance: [/b]
The 'Romance' campaign depicts the lords as merciless warriors with abilities, much like the lord system in Total War: Warhammer. They walk alone and require no retinue to cleave through the enemy troops. This mode focuses much on character vs. character combat, where lords are able to engage in duels during battles. I haven't touched this game mode yet, as I wanted to focus on the large scale battles between units, therefore I have no opinion on this campaign mode. [strike]Imagine if your lord dies during his first duel though, that would be a huge 'bruh' moment.[/strike]
[b]Records:[/b]
This is the more realistic and immersive way of playing and is of course the traditional way of playing a Total War game where generals are assigned to a bodyguard unit, and the focus solely lies with strategy and managing your units. No solo-charging with your general and leaving a wake of corpses around you. So far it has been a blast to play this campaign, which I kinda missed when I was playing the Total War: Warhammer games.


[b]Campaign map:[/b]
When I loaded into the Campaign mode for the first time, I felt overwhelmed by the lay-out. I spent a lot of time finding and navigating through different options which I would have done with ease in different Total War games. I struggled a bit to navigate through stuff like the Diplomacy screen, Character Details, City building, and etc. This could 100% be my own fault, but nevertheless it slowed my progress by a considerable amount. The advisor was sometimes pretty annoying and would sometimes get in the way so I ended up turning it off.
[b]Battles:[/b]
One of the most important parts of a Total War game; damn I love playing battles.
Playing battles in this game has been very enjoyable so far, and I don't see it changing any time soon. I never get tired of looking at the battle lines and the skirmishes. Seeing the troops fighting on the battlefield has to be the most epic part of a battle, especially because of the enormous unit scale. The 'Duel' option in the 'Romance Mode' seems like a fun mechanic, but I haven't tried it yet, so that's a shame.
I did experience a few minor annoyances during battles such as seeing too many banners on the infantry units; like way too many banners, holy shit. The arrows also look like a huge pile of shit, not gonna lie. I found the unit variety during battles to be pretty 'meh' at times, but that may be because I haven't gotten that far in the campaign yet.
Huge thumbs up for the 'Extreme' unit size option, just make sure not to overwhelm the battlefield with units or you'll have a bad time.
[b]Diplomacy:[/b]
I would like to add that I didn't expect much from this system judging by the few videos from the Total War YouTube channel and kinda thought of it as over-ambitious, but I'm glad to say that I was [b]VERY[/b] wrong. The wide variety of diplomatic options leaves an opportunity for diverse gameplay and I was thoroughly impressed by the many choices I saw when I opened the page for the first time. There are two ways of using the diplomacy screen, 'Negotiate' and 'Quick Deal'. The 'Negotiate' screen offers more options and insight to discussing diplomacy between the different factions. 'Quick Deal' offers the player an opportunity to find the most common diplomatic options. I like this approach and would love to see it in future titles.

A curated menu and UI.

Graphics in battles and campaign map are smooth at 3440x1400 in all ULTRA with a GTX1080Ti.

Mechanics are deep and complex. So much that sometimes you get loss, but if F1 is pressed, a help layer appears surrounding the most important aspects of the UI with a good explanation.

Diplomacy has been improved Nd reworked by a ton since the former title releases. The option to trade regions has come back at last.

Building is similar to Shogun 2.

Tech tree is filled with beauty and complexity, but easy to understand once get into it and how nodes influence an aspect of the macro management in particular.

Armies have been reworked with companies of heroes and military units. You now can have a total of 3 heroes and 18 units in total (21 units), compared to the armies of earlier TW which where organized in packs of 20.

Heroes can be customized with new abilities and perks once they level up, much like TW Warhammer versions.

A return to form from the somewhat over-simplified mechanics of past titles, Total War: Three Kingdoms sits in the middle ground between accessibility to newcomers and interesting nuance for veterans. Although slightly one-dimensional similar to the setting in Shogun II, the aesthetic and improvements to the game, along with unique mechanics bring out the true character of the game.

TW:3K takes many nods from Paradox games, to deliver an interesting campaign never seen before in the Total War series. Diplomacy and kingdom management are real options and can serve as a huge challenge: you will lose if you don't deal with it properly.

Mod support is coming and modders are already putting out content and fixes for the game, so even if Creative Assembly drop the ball with some balancing or content, modders could step in. Modding has always been a core part of the franchise that has been somewhat neglected recently, so hopefully there is breadth for them to add and improve to the game more this time round.

Just for perspective I have a mid-tier gaming laptop and can run this on high graphics settings with max unit sizes with no lag and a stable 50 fps. 

I've also got to say, huge props to Wheels and Tom from the community team at CA for running the streams in the lead up to launch. They've kept me entertained and wanting to play this for ages. 

The game itself is the best in the series of total war games so far, and I was a big fan of the warhammer games as well. 

Worth buying at full price on release, and I expect more interesting things to come from this title with the promise of additional chapters from the romance novel and alternate settings. (Personally I'm hoping for the Qin unification wars, being a big fan of the 'Kingdom' anime).

I have played every total war game so far and I have never seen such vast changes to how total war works. At the same time all these new mechanics feel like they belong in a Total war game.  The optimization is insane! If you thought Warhammer 2 non mortal empires had fast turn times these feel instant.  Save games and new campaigns load in about 10 seconds on my computer vs around 20s in Warhammer 2 and 45s in Rome 2.  Framerates are amazing my highish end computer can play 50 fps with everything maxed out including unit sizes. 

You could take all the mechanics they added to the game from shogun 2 to Warhammer 2 and probably not be as impressed as the changes between Thrones of Britannia and Three Kingdoms. 

11/10 as someone who has played every total war game religiously with the exception of Medieval 2 and Thrones of Britannia, none come close to being as impressive as this.  None had anywhere near this level of release polish.  None preformed as well on launch.  None had Ai that played like this on launch.

I bought it at release, and any other Rome 2 veteran who bought and played the game at release could easily tell you it was awful at first. I believe Creative Assembly (developers) learned from their mistake in Rome 2 and launched a perfect game, Total War: Three Kingdoms. I've also played other TW games such as Attila, Thrones of Britannia, WH1 and WH2, so it is fair for me to say that Creative Assembly have really outdone themselves with Three Kingdoms. I was hesitant about pre-ordering this game but after seeing how they let someone diagnosed with cancer play before release, I decided that Creative Assembly deserved my money with their generosity and great game (not sure if I am allowed to post links in steam reviews but a reddit user created a post about how his brother was diagnosed with Leukemia and had limited weeks, and his only wish was to play Three Kingdoms before he passed away, and Creative Assembly made that possible).

I pre-loaded Three Kingdoms and set an alarm at 9 AM to wake up and play this game right at release. I played it the entire day without regrets. I started a solo campaign and a co-op campaign with a friend, also did a few custom and multiplayer battles, ran across no issues at all. Only thorn that picked at me was the defense towers in cities, they are heavily over powered, but I am assuming there will be a mod that will nerf them.

If a unit is entirely destroyed in a battle, it doesn't delete the unit on the campaign map. It just makes them unavailable for a turn or two then they can replenish back to full strength over time. Also units can be recruited to generals anywhere once unlocked, so you no longer have the issue of not being able to recruit your elite units unless you are in a super developed province like in older titles.

Diplomacy exists! You can now trade territories, the AI actually accepts reasonable peace deals, you can more easily trade surpluses in one resource for another (like food for gold, or ancillaries for non-aggression pacts). This enables you to build a web of alliances if you want to help take down larger opponents. 

The battles have had numerous UI improvements to make everything much easier to see in the middle of combat. Units have an icon with a draining circle to show morale that also shows what type of unit they are. Generals can also duel, and the option gives a brief rundown of your general's odds if they accept the duel. You can also automatically decline duels if you don't want this popping up mid-fight. I will say it can be a tad tough to select the right unit in the middle of a packed brawl, but that's really my only complaint.

The building and tech systems are far more in depth than previous titles. You can make specialized food production settlements, or border provinces with larger garrisons as needed (which will be needed in a lot of the starting positions). 

The battle AI has also been improved. Enemy armies will actively try to prevent rear charges from your cavalry, I have had several occasions where a spear unit moved along with my cavalry to protect other units that were engaged in a fight. Enemy units will also use formations to reduce missile damage while charging in, and the AI will use generals according to their abilities.

Overall I love this game as my play time since launch should attest to. I've had a few failed campaigns learning the mechanics since I play on very hard, but it is a nice challenge without being unfair.

The graphics are solid with a nice cartoon-y look to the campaign map, and it's very well optimised. Running (almost) all settings on Ultra at maximum unit size yields me a solid 60-70fps with my 1060, and there's very little dips below.

The diplomacy mechanics are also very well fleshed out now. Trading territories, food, items, followers, and all the character equipment added in from the Rome, Attila, and Warhammer games, to forming confederations, and all of the classic alliances and pacts really bring out the best of the TW series.

Forming armies is changed this time around. Rather than a singular hero or general leading an army, as was the case in previous instalments after Shogun 2, 3 generals are instead fielded per army. The way this works is that any three generals can be paired together, and each can recruit up to 6 units. Each general starts with a set of units that can be disbanded and replaced or kept along with any additional units recruited. These three generals will fall under different paths and skill-sets, giving them buffs to certain units or buildings (should they be a part of the council). The generals also will get along with certain characters they come into contact with or fight alongside, or perhaps they will become enemies. This will effect their relations and effect their coordination, as sometimes this results in events that lead to debuffs for their armies.

Building chains are essentially how they almost always have been. Certain buildings can be unlocked through the ""tech"" tree, along with units. Obviously certain buildings have certain buffs or debuffs, such as producing or costing food. However, ones that caught my eye in this were Master Forges, as an example. Over time, these forges produce mid to high tier armour for your lords to use (or for other factions to buy off you). Which leads into cities.

In 3K, territories function a bit differently. Certain territories are pre-dedicated to things like farming or mining, similar to how there were mines in certain territories in Empire or Shogun 2. This time, each one is able to be captured and separate from cities. This makes it relatively easier to find and get what you need whenever there is a shortage. Cities and towns provide a little more freedom with direction, and allow you to mix and match whatever buildings you'd like.

There's plenty more additions to the game, and much more to get in-depth with, but overall I gotta say that this is a game I can see myself playing for a long time. I like it better than any other Total War at the moment (maybe matched with Empire), and that's coming from a huge Warhammer fan.

CA has been a company that has generally been good to their fans and community. With the huge exception being Rome 2's release. I've been more than willing to criticize their poorer releases/business practices. That said this title more than any other has proven that both CA and Sega their publishing company (who makes the final decisions when it comes to releasing a game) have learned from their mistakes. 

The delay has done wonders in terms of polishing and refining this game. Over this few month period CA has responded amazingly to community criticisms to beta gameplay. New unit sizes, new UI settings, new campaign graphical settings options. CA has gone out of their way to keep fans happy. They have done an amazing job. With all the deserved cynicism in the gaming community CA has become one the few companies that I will trust my preorder to. 

In terms of actual gameplay I love it so far! Amazing historical setting, awesome diplomacy & character systems are the standout features for me at the moment. This game has a mount and blade feel in terms of the quantity and quality of overlapping and interacting gameplay mechanics. That's about the highest praise I can dish out.

1. the FONTS are too small (especially for the quests/missions) which is not good for eyes, please consider to enlarge them to an appropriate size.
2.

You may not understand that our Chinese people has a very strong personal attachment to this special historical period, especially for the legendary generals (you can say that we just for playing the generals and heroes to play the three kingdoms). For the Romance game model particularly, we believe you could give options for more rounds for the game (such as 12 rounds in one year) or option to turn off the generals’ natural death due to aging.

Previous Total War: Britannia was a step backwards in a lot of ways, especially the stripped down diplomacy and politics.

Here in Three Kingdoms however it's the deepest diplomacy/politics since probably Empire.

I'll put it this way, so far I spent about 8 hours playing this game, and I'm pretty sure about 6 hours of that is in the diplomacy screen.
This is a very good direction for Total War games.
I hope they build upon this diplomacy/politics architecture for the future Total War games, add to it with updates and  Expansions and include this depth in future Total War games. It will be a real disappointment if Warhammer III won't have this diplomatic depth to it, and this is definitely the Total War game to  be playing until Warhammer III comes out in a year or two.
It's still not the kind of depth a Civilization VI has for example, but when compared to previous Total War games minimalistic diplomacy/politics, this might as well be Crusader Kings.

Probably the part about the game that i'm most impressed with so far is how much it feels like i'm playing out a story. Like in previous total war games you go ""I need to take out this settlement for the money, or to stop them attacking me"" In this you actually feel emotionally invested in it. 

I played as the bandit queen on my conquest to stop the tyranny plaguing the country side after gathering my forces and setting out to capture some iron mines belonging to my enemies I discovered that their allies had snuck into my lands and were determined to raze my newly acquired tool sheds to the ground to prevent my peasants from having stable production. I couldn't turn my army around in time and their forces were successful... The bandit queen stands for none of that, she liberated those people from their tyrant overlords, they deserve better! So she set out for revenge! she tracked them across the lands and on a cold winters night she murdered the three generals, there was no place for mercy... They had proven why the bandit queen was needed, they could have tried to take out the regime by taking out the queen, but no... They instead chose to murder the poor innocent souls who were trying to rebuild... That sort of injustice had to be repaid in kind, so we beheaded the three of them in the dead of night, their bodies left in the cold snow to be forgotten to history...

However... not everything was that simple, having chased them so far across the land, the army was now starving. Huddled up in a small fishing village in the middle of winter the cost of our revenge had started to become clear....

In short... game is amazing :O 10/10 would recommend. Important to not think of it like normal total war games, arrows hurt... they hurt alot... generals are like gods, but, even gods don't like getting shot in the face by an arrow... But, thats more akin to real life right? I ended up finding an assistant person that I could put on one of my generals that gave my army the shield wall formation which allowed shielded units to have a massive charge resistance and a 35% missile block, was around that point that I started to realise that you really just need to think of the game differently...

Pros:
-The overhaul of Generals is wonderful, they did a decent job at making them feel like they have wants, needs, desires, and ambitions and balancing these between in-faction characters and trying to pair up like minded generals is nice.
-Runs well,battles are smooth, campaign is smooth.
-pound for pound im pretty sure this is the largest TW map we've ever gotten with more settlements to conquer and strategic placement decisions to make than ever before
-Decent unit variety but could use some more

Neutral:
-Animations are a bit stiff but this is not an enormous concern for me
-Tech tree is pretty but hard to navigate at times and feels like its more trouble than its worth sometimes
-Very little faction diversity in the tech tree and building options
-Southern China is noticeably empty of starting factions, I would like to see some southern starting positions would make for an interesting dynamic since most of the key factions are up north.

Negative:
-Generals level up WAY too slowly, seeing as this is the main way you unlock higher-tier units especially your heavier infantry units this is a huge fucking problem for me heavy infantry is basically my bread and butter and I am end-game Gonsun Zan faction and still dont have heavy infantry which makes me IRRATIONALLY ANGRY
-Diplomacy received a much needed overhaul but ultimately fell flat and sometimes the AI is a little illogical.
-Espionage system basically has never worked for me in any regard other than scouting so I think a bump in favor of the player on the RNG is necessary.
-Absolutely HAVING to have a strategist in the army in order to make use of advanced formations, like such highly advanced tactics as ""lock your shields together guys"" as if a master strategist is what it takes to come up with such a plan. This for me temporarily pushes it over to a thumbs down until some of the issues ive mentioned are dealt with. I do honestly find this to be rather asinine and I think that Commanders at mid-high levels should unlock formations as well. 
-Only one faction has access to heavy infantry
-When I said southern china was empty I thought it was just no real playable factions starting down there, apparently its literally deserted down there.

For the most part I still highly recommend this game however after realizing another thing I find to be mechanically flawed and downright stupid with the game I have changed my review to a thumbs down until further notice. As patches come out I hope to see reasons to push this back to a thumbs up. Honestly between the General levelling being ridiculously slow paced after level 5 and absolutely HAVING to have a strategist in your army in order to use formations and not at least having one other general type that can use them I have to give it a negative review for now.

I have played every other title extensively and this game definitely took all the best from every world and put it into this one.

But it was one major game breaking flaw: No replayability.

The campaign(whether you play Romance or Records) is story driven. This means that AI, though incredibly intelligent, will always play the same way and that the endgame of every campaign will virtually be the same. The only difference is based on how you play. For example, if you play any northern kingdom(outlaws, Gongsun zan, zhao yung, etc) the kingdom of Wu, in the south, will always rise and be the most powerful kingdom in the land. But say you play as Cao Cao or Sun Jian, Kingdom of Song will always rise in the north and probably vassalize Dong Li(or whoever the successor may be). The game is designed to support the rise of the ""three kingdoms"" and I get that, but once you've fought it once, its not any different the second time around. It also doesn't help that, save for the yellow turban rebellion, all the factions play the same way, with slight perk and unit differential. 

I know that these issues will be addressed and fixed with coming DLC and patches, but its worth mentioning in its state now. This is probably the best TW title to date, and being someone who has an average of 500 hours per game, I'd like to be able to play it again and rack up even more. Just cant right now.

If your settlement hasn't been planned you will be handicapping yourself. The campaign side of things play more like the historical side of total war. On the flip side the battles play a lot more like warhammer where having a beef general can make the difference in a battle (FIY I think recorded mode plays more like old the total war games). The big different is the duel mode which personally I think is a good things and a bad thing. Good as it is a cool feature and love watching them but bad as sometimes they have duels in the worst possible places eg. behind enemy lines which either makes them route or worst kills them.

This review will focus mostly on what makes 3K good and different from previous Total War games. The basic gist of the game is the same. Build your armies. Recruit your generals. Paint the map your colour.

The game runs smooth. No lag whatsoever both on the map and in battles, which is a first for me when it comes to Total War games. Warhammer runs well, but it can chug a bit in very large battles.
Even battles with 4 full stack armies going at it during a city siege battle doesn't lag in 3K. This is probably because the game further refines the Warhammer combat system in that there are very few ""finishing"" moves (or matched combat as I believe the technical term is).
In Warhammer this could on occasion look a bit boring as units would just swipe somewhere in the enemy's general direction. In 3K every unit is either infantry or cavalry, so they've done a much better job in actually making it look like they're hitting each other.  Troops can also climb walls much like in Shogun 2 (they use grappling hooks) so the AI has an easier time of it too.

They could've settled for a Shogun 2 in China, but instead it has a ton of unique features that sets it apart from the older games:

- Character relationships (more than just A is married to B, generals actually remember specific acts which alters how they feel about one another. Even generals that fight each 
other can become friends.

- Every character has his own equipment and skill tree, much like in Warhammer but more to the point.

- Building trees have far more depth to them than both Shogun and Warhammer. It's more than just building farms and barracks all over the place. Population plays a large factor. If a city is maxed out, public order drops. If you upgrade the city to make room, you 
 may run out of food which drops public order. If you build tax buildings you'll lose more public order. Rebellions are guaranteed if you're not careful.

- Romance mode is a unique feature on its own. It adds a lot of fantasy elements to it such as famous generals having very powerful abilities that can turn the tide.

- Historical events take place *during* the campaign. Without spoiling any of them, you can choose to break away from history (or the novel) when these events are presented to you. Some of them can lead to negative consequences.

- Diplomacy works. The AI doesn't act like an asinine idiot in this game. They actually have good reason to ask you for things and will offer alliances when it's beneficial to them. Diplomacy is also affected by personal relationships and behaviour. If they're poor, they'll value gold. If they're starving, they'll value food. If they're powerful, they'll try to vassalize you. If you're powerful, they'll try to appease you.

- Campaigns are tailor made for the faction you're playing. They all have unique missions and events.

- The Emperor plays a large role and basically affords you a free ally if you manage to secure him. 

- Unique and powerful units require a similarly powerful general to lead them. Armies are loyal to their commander, not their faction. Every 6 units are led by a general. Units cannot be swapped between generals.

As an aside: the default graphics settings make the game look blurry. Change the Anti-aliasing and turn off Depth of Field for much crisper visuals. It's a good looking game. They did go for a more colourful look rather than bleak realism.

Optimization: 10/10
I have everything on Ultra with an Nvidia 1080. Runs perfectly, no issues. Whereas Thrones of Brittania and Warhammer 2 both had to have settings lowered. An Warhammer 2 makes my PC hot. Works the fans. This game? Cool as a cucumber. 

Gameplay: 8/10 overall. 
Campaign - 9/10
Battle - 7.5/10

The campaign aspects are great. Spies, trading land, ect ect. The diplomacy aspects. However, the short movement range is annoying and the lack of unique characters is also a disappointment. A LOT of familar faces. Which sucks. That said, it isn't enough to make you hate the campaign. An that's coming from an RoTK vet. 
Battle is good, not great. WAY better than ToB, but with archers having such crazy range - you never really get to utilize formations much, and a lot of the starting units cannot use formations anyways. So it devolves into the same old same old, rock paper scissors gameplay. Cav kill archers, spearmen kill cav, melee units line up and fight. 

Romance mode makes the game. The heroes, the duels - very fun. 

I have been avoiding sieges though, as Arrow towers are still OP as of launch. They had said in streams they were aware of the issue and were working on it, but apparently have not fixed it at launch. As an arrow tower two shots my heroes. 
Also I don't think armies should take attrition IMMEDIATELY when under siege. It's easily abusable by players, and annoying when it happens to you. However, easily avoidable if you see the army coming. As you just move your army out and reinforce the settlement. 

Voice acting: 5/10 The english sounds horrible to me anyways. Doesn't effect the game much, but I wish they had hired better voice actors. Sounds very 1980s kung fu. Without the weird hyah noises. 


I haven't tried multiplayer, but for myself, I buy these games for the single player experience. So that is what I am reviewing. 

I say it's worth the full price tag. Have already got 9hrs in it, on the day of launch lol. 
It's honestly, the most enjoyable Three Kingdoms inspired game I have ever played and I have played them all, from RotK to Kessen 2, with sprinklings of Dynasty Warriors here an there. (PS2 era was the best) 
Far as Total War goes...I have played 3 total war games. Warhammer 2, ToB, and now this. I honestly think this game has the potential to be the best I have ever played. An I have sunk 1700+ hours into Warhammer 2.

- Veteran Total War player since Shogun 1 through Three Kingdoms.
- i7, RAM 16 GB, GTX 1050Ti 4GB, SSD 
- I have watched Three Kingdoms TV series (version 2010). 
- My race is Chinese (overseas) 

I guess you have already read/watched many other players' reviews, so I am not going to repeat the same parts. But I am going to give you ideas that most other players cannot give you, from the perspective of a veteran Total War player who has played all Total War titles since Shogun 1. So I know Creative Assembly and the Total War series better than most players here. 

I know that the reviews will be mostly positive, but there are some negative reviews mostly from casual players or new to Total War. That's where I am going to address so that you will understand the game and its concept better:

OVERALL 
As I mentioned earlier that I am of Chinese race, and I have watched the whole Three Kingdoms TV series (version 2010) before, so I am very well familiar with the story and Chinese tradition. I can assure you that this game depicts the story, environment, feeling quite well. So CA has successfully preserved the world's heritage quite well in the game (or ""lore friendly"" if you like).

And as a veteran Total War player, I admit that this game is probably (I need more hours to say 100%) the best and the most delicate game in Total War series. 
  
THE GRAPHIC 
Some people have complained that the graphic looks very cartoonish. But what they don't understand is that CA has tried to make it look like a story book (or art book, if you like), it's like you play through an interactive story/art book. That's is very good because that makes this game unique from the previous Total War titles, and it represents Chinese tradition well. 

The frame rate on my machine is much better than TW:Warhammer too. Because in this game I can run high setting with 240 unit scale at constant 60 FPS. 

THE NEW GAMEPLAY SYSTEM
Some people have also complained this area mainly because of the new ""character relationship"" system introduced in this game where it focuses so much and deeply on how you treat the characters. But what the complaining people don't understand is that Three Kingdoms (the novel story) has a lot to do with employing/using/manipulating people, in fact many modern business companies learn and adopt personnel management from Three Kingdoms the novel. So the novel is all about employing/manipulating people for your cause. Creative Assembly understands the core concept of the novel so well. And that's why they had to make sure that the game also focuses on character relationship. Because in the novel, many generals/consultants leave their masters because they are not satisfied how their master treat them. And this game also reflects character's satisfaction toward the master. I found myself being paranoid, reluctant to hire a new candidate because I was afraid that they might be spies sent by another faction :) Yes it is that good ! 

BATTLE AI
As you know Creative Assembly's AI has a reputation, LOL. But in this game the AI is not so bad. They might be a little panic/freaking out when you give them a lot of pressure, but they can get their shit together and put up quite a good fight. For example, when I attacked their walled city, after they saw that they were losing on the walls, some of them retreated to defend the plaza while leaving a few units engaged with me on the walls to buy their time. 

ARMY SYSTEM
This game intentionally limits how many armies you can field depending on factors such as your tech-research, prestige level, etc. And it takes 5 - 10 turns for your army to be fully replenished/recruited. This is to make all your army movements/decisions meaning full. Now you have to plan and make decisions carefully regarding your troops. No more troop spamming and spreading all over. Same thing goes for the AI. 

And as you know through out human history, we have seen human generals fighting battles worse than CA's AI. Take Game of Throne Season 8 for example. So when you take the panic/freaking/shitting in pants factors into consideration, the AI can be accepted. 

LEARNING CURVE
As I mentioned earlier that this game introduces many new systems and features, so even for a veteran player like me, it took me about 2-3 hours to get used to and learn all the stuff. But it's very easy to learn, everything is self-explanatory and has tool tips, so it's not Europa Universalis' level of complexity. Don't be afraid there is nothing complex in this game, you just need a few hours to get used to and know where is where, that's all. 

CONCLUSION
The full price can be daunting to some people, but if you think this game is what you are looking for, I can assure you that comparing to the amount of works/study/research CA has invested in this masterpiece, the full price is nothing at all. You will be enjoy playing this game for years to come.

Launch optimization tends to be bad, content tends to feel a little bare, and while the game is fun it usually takes a few months (and maybe a few mods) to really feel the Total War joy.

However, just as an empire long united must divide, a trend long standing must be broken. Total War: Three Kingdoms may be among the best optimized launches I have seen in the last few years. The refreshing of mechanics keeps gameplay fresh, rewarding, and exciting. The gameplay pace is taking me a while to figure out, but this has kept me engaged as I find myself contending with the chaos of a China at war.

Graphically, the game is superb, and runs far better on my machine than prior TW titles despite the notable graphical enhancements. This also has an impact on the weight of battles: with the new extreme unit size and tracking of commandery populations, war's cost is notably tangible. Both Romance mode and Records mode provide a fun, engaging experience, although Records would be the flavor of choice for the more traditional Total War enthusiast.

Click Play, start campaign, start battle

Why is it running smooth like a butter? :D

Anyway, the game works!

*Edit:

I played Liu Bei on third playthrough, 1st and 2nd is Cao Cao and Liu Bei for testing things and playing around.

Anyway, it's quite good, but I don't really like the late campaign though, it forces you to fight three best faction (includes me) to fight for the right to be emperor. The thing is, the second best faction is my highest income vassal (got Sun Jian as vassal through sheer luck (?) and trinkets, lots of trinkets) and the third one is Gongsun Zan which is my Ally. Good thing only Sun Jian declares war on me, if not I'm doomed, since all of my general are on the west side of the map.

It seems there aren't any naval battle (well I understand it only has two or three main river on the map but still..). I love the Naval Map in Dynasty Warrior series.

Be careful of duels, at the moment you think you are winning, then you realized you are fighting a sentinel with a skill that makes him/her even dangerous the longer he/she fights.

I still don't like the fact that unit is tied to general, not really flexible, but it works fine in this game I guess. (Unless you are Yuan Shao with his Captain Recruit Skill)

It's funny to see factions aiming for my trinkets, but whenever I look at theirs... empty.

Yuan Shao vassal hoarding is really annoys me, he manages to force me to ""vassal"" myself to him on the 1st Liu Bei playthrough, but the 2nd one, I attack the north first, declare war, and manages to vassalize him (Take that Yuan Shao!)

Cao Cao never manages to build his Kingdom of Wei on every playthrough :(

I've got this funny story with Liu Bei though:
> When Tao Qian's Dilemma shoots up, choose to side with him
> Cao Cao declares war on me
> Still busy fighting for north territory (Huang Shao and Han Empire)
> After a few turns, Cao Cao still doesn't show up, I got suspicious
> Have a peace with Huang Shao, moves back the army and hides it in the bushes near capital, Langyang(?) (I was still a noble so only, one army, so tedious!)
> I got lucky, he showed up, using marching stance to the capital
> I attacked him though battered and outnumbered, manages to win

> I captured Lady Bian

So many features that make the campaign side of the game deeper. Some features have made a return, like being able to trade territories or move your capital. Others have been reinvented like the spy system. The commandery system is great, they took the best parts of it from Thrones of Britannia, as well as the recruitment style. Performance is very good. It's been noticeably better for me than Warhammer 2, with unit sizes nearly double those of Warhammer, so I would say the game is well optimized. Finally, there are just so many little things that Creative Assembly have done in terms of listening to feedback during the development process. They added new unit cards because people didn't like the original ones, they added horse armor like a week before launch because people were complaining that none of the heavy cavalry had any armor on the horses. Moving capital was not originally in the game, but they added it in after fans demonstrated a desire for it. There are a lot of what I will call ""good faith"" additions, things that aren't necessary for the game to be enjoyable, but absolutely enhance the experience, things that show that CA really wanted this game to be a deep and satisfying experience for the player.

There is so much more to do and think about. Developing your settlement actually requires thought. And finally real family trees again!  The battles are much the same, but they are still a blast. The duelling is a great addition that needs to make it to Warhammer.

My army and the enemy army met at a river crossing. Both our armies stopped and just looked at each other on our respective sides of the river. I was offered a duel, my champion vs theirs. They met in the shallow part of the river and the duel began, both sides troops watched!

After a long fight my man emerged victorious. The AI not satisfied challenged me again all while their army watched too. My man won again by which point the AI had enough (plus they only had one general left). Their army charged my champion and I responded in kind.

Actual in depth diplomacy and choices that matter when it comes to dealing with other factions and the crazy amount of options you have on hand when you negotiate with others is mental. Want a province with a copper mine and the faction that currently owns it has a very poor food economy with farmers not producing much food? Offer to send annual shipments of food to them in exchange for the copper province. Want to sweeten the deal even more? Throw in a marriage or annual payments for good measure to get in their good graces. The espionage system is without a doubt the best in the series, where instead of one specific character that you can recruit solely for the purpose of spying, you can send in someone from your faction to join anothers to gain intel and screw with them. A spy general can revolt with his army, a governor spy can ""accidentally"" leave the gates to the town open for your armies to march in and if you have a spy inside of the actual royal family you can pull as many strings as you'd like.

Battles are alright, though not as stellar as the campaign gameplay. If you want a traditional TW battle experience play with Records mode, as Romance mode is much more fantastical with generals being able to solo entire armies by themselves. Siege battles are finally good again, and minor settlement battles are great.

I'm bored 5 minutes into it.  And that really is the ultimate sin of this game, it feels like a chore to play it.  Modders, please fix this game.  I truly don't know if that is possible because the entire framework needs revisiting.  But, this is incredibly depressing to not want to open this game and play it.  I started with Romance of the Three Kingdoms I on the NES.  I transitioned back and forth to Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Tactics and before that Nobunagas Adventure, Ghengis, I even loved AeroBiz, and Bandit Kings of Ancient China.  I even played Destiny of an Emperor on the NES and somehow downloaded it's sequel, I want to say it was entirely in Japanese, and beat this too.  I'm devoted.  This RTK BS game does a disservice to all those in the series that came before it.  Play it, you will see.

I'll name one major flaw in this game, there are SO many flaws, but here's one problem - I do like that creating a City from scratch is expensive if the area is abandoned.  It makes holding cities a priority and it keeps the game from expanding too fast.  But, unfortunately, the AI is not thus constrained - Sun Jian literally buys all of southern china in 30 turns.  Let's look at that economically - 8,000 gold per City x 30 (to be conservative) = 240,000.  Ur annual gold intake will be anywhere between 500 and 5000.  Lets assume 3000 gold from an average perspective.  That means that it would take 80 turns for Sun Jian to populate southern china if all he did was save money and create cities.  Yet he does it in less than 30 turns.  This is just one small issue, I'll leave the bigger issues to others but this game sucks.

I would sell this game back to CA for $0.99 but they don't even think it is worth that much.",1558651713,1559266354,False,0.4333401918411255,True,False,False,342,en

If you do care about zooming down and watching combat, WAIT for blood and gore DLC and hope that it adds better flow and matched anims. Otherwise beware that factor.

Pros
- Love the theme
- Mix of warhammer's combat, MTW 2's combat and Atilla's combat in terms of animations both matched and static. 
- Beautiful cities.
- Atilla fire mechanics
- Cool hero duel systems and dialog
- large armies
- Good options menu. Lots of small things to add or remove depending on taste. 
- Colision seems to work better. Unit combat as well. Very mixed, lotta hitting and not dying, makes battle last longer and we have more of a wound and brush it off kind of system instead of just dropping dead immediately. 
More push, more impact. So well done, CA. 


Cons
-Top issue to me personally is the icon / UI elements. There are too many. Too much green, too many flowing bars with data. Its just too f'ing much, CA. I can't see the freaking battlefield at times. Its freaking ridiculous. I mean look at this shit.

Only way to make this better is by hitting K and then I can get a more realistic visual but cannot command my army properly. Other total wars had a nice balance to this. 3K has thrown that out the window entirely. Please fix this. Either devs or modders. Its fucking infuriating and almost making me thumb down this review because of it.

This is WAY... too drastic in visual overlay. Absolutely too much going on here. Very uncomfortable to look at. 

- Graphics feel dated concerning the terrain and lighting. I had hoped for Warhammers graphics at the bare minimum but I see things from atilla and rome. Grass especially looks bad. Character models look okay, mostly the heroes but Warhammers visuals were better. Simple fact. 

- Not enough matched combat for normal troops. I had hoped for a better balance between MTW2 and Warhammer. Clumped toether = Static kill. 1v1 = matched kill. It doesn't happen as much as I'd like to enhance the visual flow of gritty combat. Maybe with blood and gore DLC however. 

-Custom battle interface. Its a complete fucking mess. It is very clunky, completely mashed together and uncomfortable to look at. i dont know if its image proportionality or something but the WHOLE screen is crammed together and its not nice at all to look at. its s bad that they literally have the select siege or land battle options on ANOTHER screen. 
The UI in this game  but in battle and in custom is not good in the slightest. Very messy and overly large.

-Unit sizes. Now, I get this is due to balancing reasons but I still dont enjoy this element. Compared to the amount of infantry you have your cavalry is incredibly miniscule. I wish  we could have larger cavalry regiments. But thats a personal gripe and can be edited via mods. I just dont like units that are too small. Everything else is great. No criticism other than cavalry sizes. 


Last thoughts: Please add blood, gore and give us some more matched combat for 1v1 between heroes AND more importantly, normal soldiers that fight. I like to watch battles. I always have and thats why I play Total War. 
3k's battles are currently 5-6 out of 10 for the soldiers. 8-9 out of 10 for the heroes.

Add more matched dynamic kill anims for 1v1 situations alike MTW2 had, throw in some blood and gore and then I'll happily rate the entire combat experience a solid 8-9 out of 10 for soldiers and a glowing 10 for heroes. 

Time shall tell. For now however I am thumbing this up because its an okay game with lots of potential but I personally recommend ANYONE who plays this for watching combat.... wait for blood and gore DLC. If thats your thing ofc. Because we really lack some better visually impressing combat so far. 


And last note. CA, PLEASE give us an option to REMOVE unit icons hovering over my regiments, WITHOUT pressing K., Its driving me fucking insane to see 32423432432 icons in a huge pile of soldiers already covered by 32423432 flags.
Atilla had such an option if memory serves. Lots of toggleable features like firing arcs and such.

If this game has this and you know dear reader, PLEASE COMMENT IT. Because I tried to find it but couldnt. So by all means correct me if its there and help me enjoy the game. 

But yes. I'd like to actually see the combat and not a billion indicators of various things I can't keep track of anyway because I command 42 freaking units. Lol",1558642749,1558642749,True,0.52173912525177,True,False,False,820,en

(+) I have played a few custom matches and the unit combos and movements are awesome. 

(-) The flags on the units are too many and is blocking the visual of soldiers and battle. I understand that historically they had so many flags: however, for the game visual must be crucial than the flag! Those flags are just too many and I really annoyed by them. 1 is enough for one battalion. 

(-) I felt like it is still a beta. 
(-) The graphics are not better than the other TW franchises.  It looks so bad when I scroll close to the units and its so blurry! 
(-) The units are not responding at once. After I give command it takes atleast 10 sec to initiate. ( They afk for too long) 

(+) Variety of soldiers which felt nice 
(+) Generals felt awesome as they fight and have special moves etc 

In custom game A player needs to place enemy soldiers so the player can play any way they want. Because, bots are placed automatically everywhere. Which is not giving freedom to the player. 

I have played and bought all the TW franchises and this one has the worst graphics. 

As I have played a few hours it feels like beta. the graphics are not completely done or they used some cheaper engine (I really don't know why it feels like that) 

Maybe, they will update it. But until then I will not recommend it.

Personally I find this a welcoming challenge. 

So, what is new?

Well, as stated the game is beautiful. Gorgeous graphics and larger than life personalities set in a vibrant world with beautiful towns, fields, and landscapes. The audio is on par, with an excellent and fitting soundtrack and solid voice casting, be it in English or Chinese! The combat itself might be a bit of a shuffle, but the duels are generally well rendered. Overall the graphics and the world are well made and well done. 

The combat itself isn’t that much new. If you go for historical mode you will be very familiar with everything, which is both good and bad. There is innovation, but there is also just a hint of the same old, same old. Going romance mode you will still be familiar with most of it, especially if you played either of the Warhammer titles. The new mechanic most worth mentioning is the duel mechanic, though once duels are issued and accepted there’s not much you can do about them, except for the rare ability, or telling your character to run away. Duels once started take care of themselves. I do not quite know if I like that or not. 

So, that’s a lot of sugar, any salt? Well, as mentioned the diplomacy and management have been improved and need a bit more effort. Overall that is all good, but there is vassalage. I found that the computer tends to get the ability to create vassals before you, especially Yuan Shao, and that tears everything apart, just as you feel you have managed to create some stability here and there. Even factions in a coalition with you will abandon the safety of that coalition in favor of being vassals. Within a handful of turns of the first vassal the political landscape will be torn apart and the result is chaos and major wars everywhere. In the end coalitions seem to have little point, because vassalage makes any such faction unstable and unreliable at best, or destroys it in a couple of turns at worst. Vassalage, I found, partially ruins the otherwise wonderful diplomacy. Nothing mattered. 

That said, the rest of the game is good, very good. Battles can be challenging and you  might find yourself outnumbered relatively often. Balancing early expansion and actually having an economy at all was quite the fun trick. 

Now, I usually rate my games, with a d6, except a 0 is also possible, and occasionally x,5s. Nothing that strange here. This is a solid 5/6, and I believe this is only the third time I have ever given a game 5/6.",1558640295,1558741702,True,0.5947117209434509,True,False,False,495,en

The trap however was foiled,  outnumbered Ma Teng's noble retainer Pang De fell in the line of duty.   Oaths were sworn on that day, and  the next year Ma Teng returned to Wudu with a vengeance, slaying Gong Du, and put down the rebellion in the year 193.  The next ten years are spent solidifying his control of the West, as Ma Teng bides his time to strike out against the tyrants holding the emperor hostage.  Now the year is 210,  adviced by the wise Sima Yi,  Ma Teng once again strikes the drums of war, and vows vengeance upon those that desecrate the Emperor of the Han.  

That was my first 10 hours or so of the game,  honestly it feels so immersive, runs like a charm loading times are shorter, game is in other words well optimized.   Battles are pretty tough, and the campaign is pretty darn tough.   Maintaining officer satisfactions are pretty hard.   

 So far I have nothing to complain about, I expect each and every campaign to become unique, on this game, Lady Wu has become the second strongest warlord on the map, going as far as vassalizing the number one Liu Bei, who seemingly lost his sworn brother Zhang Fei cause he's in an army threatening my northern border.

The diplomacy and campaign AI (omitting army chasing) have made for some of the best total war experiences I've had in the series. 


Previous review:

Might be fun if I didn't spend the entire game chasing around armies that were in constant retreat. Wasting time while my cities fell. This is a game flaw that has been around since almost the first in the series. 

CA, you need to fix this. It's not hard. Let me show you. Every time an army retreats, reduce their movement by half the following turn. It's that bloody simple.",1558637199,1558955525,True,0.40398892760276794,True,False,False,152,en

As a veteran total war player, I felt that the franchise was becoming too streamlined and i was worried what would become of Total War after it had completed the Warhammer trilogy, especially with the disappointing Thrones of  Britannia and the delays for this game. 

Thankfully, the game exceeded my expectations and although I have played this for only 6 hours at the time of writing this, I can say with confidence that this is up there with Rome and Medieval 2.

The most major upgrade is without doubt diplomacy. With the near absence of natural obstacles and lots of potential enemies it has become very important to manage your relations with other powers. The presence of a ""Make this Work"" button is also a great improvement to diplomacy and thus it makes it more fun to play with unlike Warhammer Diplomacy.

The role of Commanders in romance mode is also a neat feature. I loved watching my best warrior fighting a duel with an enemy champion whilst both armies simply watched, making the combat all the more satisfying. Also, the level of complexity added with managing your subordinates is another much welcomed feature.

The mustering, supplying and food mechanics from Thrones make a return with much needed improvements but I feel that I can't go into more detail since I didn't buy Thrones so you may want to compare the systems mentioned in both games to know what I'm talking about.

I can also say that the AI has improved, at least on the campaign map and from what I have seen. In my Cao Cao playthrough, my enemy seized  my livestock farm but with heavy looses and I was poised to strike with a fresh force to retake it. Realising this, the AI army abandoned the farm and went into ambush mode to become hidden and avoid destruction.

I also really like that CA also listened to fan complaints about the game prior to the delays and gave us extreme unit sizes and alternative unit cards, it is much appreciated. I also love the fact that after playing one playthrough, you are encouraged to do another one as the option to play as Dong Zhou is unlocked. 

I do have a few gripes with the game such as the limited trade options and the bad U.I for diplomacy but on the whole it is a excellent game worth playing. It is nothing like previous total war games and i really want to see the features introduced to future total wars, particularly Warhammer 3. It fully deserves my score of 9/10. 

Btw, i would have given a thumbs up anyway due to the fact that the population mechanic makes a welcome return.",1558637025,1558643137,True,0.5454545617103577,True,False,False,460,en

-Graphic: Very nice, the campaign map is beautiful. Too bad that aside from legendary heroes, there is so few unique portraits for other characters ( Hoping for future DLCs). If you like grittier visual, then select record option in the graphic menu.

-Sound: There is chinese dub in the game and they sound great, the music is nice too.

-Gameplay: Messing around the game a bit and there are a few things to note:
+ Pros: Much better diplomacy , many new systems like espionage or relationships make the game more interesting and complex. The abilities to choose Romance or Record mode ( more realistic) is a nice touch.

+Cons: New UI looks nice but needs time to get used to, the UI for settlement development seem cluttered ( I prefer the Rome, warhammer style)

+Mixed: AI campaign is good but sometime they really stupid ( Yuan Shao keep falling for my ambushes every single time LOL) Can't say much about battle AI either.

Overall, the game left a very good impression to me. And I'm excited for future improvement of the game.

However, what is most striking is just how smooth and finely tuned the game is.  Running on an older gfx card (R9 390) and i7-4770, it performs ~40-50fps at ultra for me in all but the most chaotic battles- with no stuttering.  Whatever  they did to the engine, kudos.

As a new player, you will be thrown down a lot of new aspects in a total war that you haven't seen before but worry not! this total war has one of the greatest tutorials ever in a total war game, not many have mentioned it as probably a lot of players aren't new here around but the possibility to click the exclamation mark and go directly to a video made by one of the developers telling you how that mechanic is working it's really nice! so props to them.

Also before we go to the more in-depth review I wanted to comment something about the price of the game and future DLC's, yes guys this it's a 60$ game but think how many hours have you spend in it? it's cheaper to play than to go and see a movie as each hour of a movie in my country it's  between 4/6 $ an hour and so far for this game with 80 hours played means I expended 0,56$ for each hour I have put into it since I bought the game for around 45$ in an official reseller. Since this game has no micro I understand CA with the bleeding content of DLC's after all they have to pay their employees... Some of the content that they release surely should be a part of the game but let's put something straight here, every single of you knows what's gonna happen when you buy a game like this.  Many other games which are f2p or p2b (Warframe/newly arrived Conquerors blade even monster hunter world) gets monetized one way or another but from my experience, this total war has been one of the most worth to date as a naked release. 

Now let's go with the review:

Positive aspects of the game:

+Graphics ( the game might not be as awesome as WH1/2 but surely will work better as the performance hit is much less than WH) meaning it can run in older computers

+Newly implemented spies system ( many doesn't know how it works but it's awesome once you learn the way ;).  )

+Heroe duels

+Battles (The maps are awesome, battles are fast I would say a bit slower than in WH)

+Diplomacy (makes this game feel alive)

+It has co-op ( although it could be improved)

+Two different modes to play the game: Records and Romance

+Replayability 

+Workshop for TW games it's awesome! thanks, modders <3


Negative aspects of the game: 

-Battles (AI can be retarded sometimes and defeated easily once you cheese it out but for the majority of players won't be like this)

-Balance (some factions were op but they are being worked out to get balanced)

-Diplomacy ( some people will get annoyed when so many interactions are sent to you I personally love this.)

-Units (the majority of the units are the same, although they will add more as time progresses in any case I do not expect so many changes between factions as it's a historical game not fantasy like WH)


From all the negative aspects the worse is the AI (I'm an experienced TW player and other RTS) although it's challenging it could be better  I only hope that someday people can implement Machine learning  into the TW series as it has happened with Dota, to get a proper AI player but we are miles away from it to happen. 

Now the choice is yours to buy the game, I personally do not regret it compared to other games I bought recently and I think this game it's awesome even if it's not perfect!  An awesome and great RTS for this year.

If you think the price it's too expensive for you I recommend to wait for sales but definitely, this game should be a buy if you like RTS.

TL: DR Game overall is good in all the aspects, AI could be improved even if it falls behind the game is worth your time and money!",1558624064,1561016073,True,0.0,False,False,False,700,en

Now that I have time to play more, my love for this game is growing. I don't know much about the period though Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a word that I have heard for decades but have never read the book or even play other games related to this period. 

While having prior knowledge about this period is not a required to play this game, I would suggest anyone to at least learn a bit about this period to understand about the story. While this is not a first Total War game that gives character focus, I find this game much better than expanded than Warhammer. Maybe because none of the characters are immortals and what I like most is that depending on your game, some unknown character may become legendary through their actions in the game.

This is also the first Total War game that I really take some time before ending a turn. There's so much to do, though not in a bad way I would say. It's no longer build or upgrade this building, raise and army and decide where to attack as in other Total War games. The nature of the map where threats can come from anywhere makes you really think what is the best course of action before you end the turn.

Battles are like any other Total War games and I feel the AI is slightly better. Yes, there are the usual idiotic stuff like AI units sit still under missile arrows etc but overall I do feel there's an improvement even compared to Warhammer 2 and Thrones of Brittania (which for me are the best battle AI in the series). Not perfect, but great and enjoyable nevertheless.

Diplomacy has improve a lot. Maybe for someone that like Paradox games may find the new Total War diplomacy as barebones but for me who never have like Paradox games (I only played CK2 less than 2 hours) finding this new breath of fresh air in a Total War games. No more straight negotiation (though it can be done) but now you can barter and lots more other options. It may not seem a lot earlier in the campaign but once you level up, there are hosts of other available options that you can choose.

Back to the performance, I'm using Ryzen 5 2600 and RX 580. The recommended settings gives me High with Normal unit numbers. Benchmarks give me 50+ fps. Using the Extreme unit numbers drop the frames by roughly 5 fps. I tested on Ultra setting with Extreme unit size giving me around 35-38 fps which I find very much playable (for me) for a Total War game. Of course if you're someone who needs to have 60 fps then Medium/High should be able to give you that. In any case, even with average 30 fps, the game is very optimized and I did not find any stuttering when playing the campaign on full 21 vs 21 units battle.

Below is my benchmark.

If your someone like me who grew up playing dynasty warriors and total war then this game is a must for you , it enchances of the dipolmacy aspect more then real time battles which is ashame i more excited to stay in the campaign and auto resolve more because its just so much better . Overall its the step in the right direction , would recommend to return total war veterns who wants a solid taste of the historical genre . 

RECOMMEND YOU ALL TO  WATCH ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 2010 LINK BELOW FOR EPISODE 1 ENGLISH SUB 

Its a 90 episode historical drama series starting from the entry of Dong Zhuo to the death of Sima yi. Filled with  strategy , loyalty , romance and compelling setting i hope you all enjoy the drama and thank creative assembly for this wonderful game !!

-------------------------------
For a start, i haven't put enough into this beauty yet, but i just had to write a small review.
That said, this combines two things i love allot.
CA, thank you for combining not only one of my favorite hystorical periods, but actually creating a total war game about one of my most favorite books, Romance of the Three kingdoms, written by Luo Guanzhong.

The game looks fantastic, runs fantastic and to see the heroes clash in battle is a just inspiring.
The diplomacy system has been upgraded, The battles look better and the voice acting is phenominal.

I could go on and on about this game.
But the only thing i can actually say to you guys now is a simple thank you.
To all that are playing enjoy the game.

Literally no total war has been this way it was always you had the option to do something and whatever choice you made gives you a certain trait. So in a sense i should be able to get rid of these people and than get the cruelty trait i shouldn't need to start with it to make these options.

+the Romance mode is cool.
+ The game is almost-polished. I have seen four bugs during almost 2 hours of my gameplay. Path finding issues (but hay that’s total war)
+/ - Tutorials are very informative and pieces of advice are useful. The interface is very crowded 100% Diplomacy is way better than anything else, Diplomacy is one of the reasons why you'd want to play the main campaign a few more times.
+ An interesting campaign but once you get a feel for it sure to have good replay values.
- Average visuals on the global map; in battles they are pretty much the crap unless you running a super computer.
Still, I have a few doubts probably see DLC flying into the store in a few weeks and what the F/DUCK where is the gore let me guess DLC.

The gameplay changes are something that Total War fans will generally like and appreciate, with most being steps in the right direction. 

As for my chief complaint about this game, it is that 3440x1440 monitor ""support"" seems to only be decreasing the size of the UI to unreadable levels. Portraits, unit cards, text, even the character selection screen are simply decreased in size to fit across the monitor. Alt-tabbing or viewing the desktop, then going back to the game results in the mouse pointer being inaccurate and off-centered. The UI will sometime turn into gray polygons, with only a complete computer restart fixing the issue. I eagerly await official support for this, or will need to use a 3rd party tool.

I know that the 1v1s caused some issues with the AI just standing and watching but I personally prefer that much more than a simple slash and the enemy falling down because It makes it feel more like a realistic setting. Also, the duels can get pretty repetitive after a few times. Everything else seems like an improvement so if you don't mind that then you should love this game.

Was a bit worried that after three years of Warhammer would be difficult to return to a historical main title, but scale and scope of the setting drags you in straight away.

There is a fair bit to learn as the campaign has a lot of depth and struggling a bit with the names etc. as relationships play a big part and I'm totally unfamiliar with the setting which is a first for me. Started with Gongsun Zan as this looked your more traditional soldier type and my sort of bloke. Looks like there is a fair bit of replayability with the different factions available on day 1.

Playing on a pretty old rig GTX 750 TI so most graphic settings downgraded but still handling extreme unit size with about 40 fps zoomed out. Seems pretty smooth. Looking forward to getting home and firing up my new rig which I purchased for TWW 2 and cranking up the settings.

The graphics are pretty solid though not to everyone's taste., though like the brighter colors in romance mode more, has it brings  things to life like something you would expect based on china's history, records more is your normal total war graphics more down to earth and what you expect. 

Also was pleased that CA was not joking when they said you can unlock the Tyrant by beating his army or finishing the campaign . Found the fastest way to get him was rampage a bit in  his lands has the bandit queen, then slap him around when he comes knocking, and oh don't let him go when you catch him, you need to do what is fitting to unlock in this mnethold

Could go on , but that is it for now. 9/10 .

This is not a review to discourage others not to buy the game, I intend it as a petition to the developers. I am sure they'll do something about this and I'll change my review to positive, as I enjoyed all the previous Total War titles for years:
I bought the game mainly for the purpose of improving my Chinese by exposing myself to the language. Alas, the text is extremely small and almost unreadable. One needs eagle's eyes to make something out of it. Warhammer Chinese version was good but this one somehow was ignored. I know I am still learning the language and it plays a part in the difficulty I am having, yet I am sure even the Chinese themselves will have difficulty reading that small font, especially when I think of Total War Warhammer and other games that have full Chinese support. Also, there doesn't seem to be subtitles for the cutscenes.

Dear developers, I know you'll have your hands full with other improvements, but please do not just say this is a one man comment and doesn't deserve attention and do something about it for the sake of your potential millions of Chinese customers too.

I love the battles of the special guys going at it while the normal big fight you are controlling is going on. Chaos everywhere and these 2 are just dueling it out, bless them. The campaign map is also drop dead gorgeous! Runs well to, no crashes in 25+ hours, the game is in real nice shape.

The best improvement so far?? THE DIPLOMACY!! Finally well done diplomacy in TW! This is very welcome! It also runs really well and the awesome family stuff from Shogun 2 is back and better than ever.

This game looks absolutely stunning and really brings a fascinating era of history to life. It reminds me of Shogun 2 in terms of how unified the art style, UI, music, and general flavor of the game are. The campaign mode is deeper than ever before, and the battles occupy a nice middle ground between the over-the-top fantasy of Warhammer and previous historical titles in Romance mode. The Chinese voice acting is also superb, and I'd encourage anyone playing to switch to it immediately.

It's a really beautiful game. I'm forcing myself to stop after the first hour because I have to head out for a bit. I'll be back playing later to see how far I can push my fledgling Cao Cao campaign.

Lots of little details and interrelated features put back into the campaign, but done with a really light touch. Have found it very intuitive and further information highlighted when it might be needed. 

Few small battles played as well as a couple of ingame benchmarks run. 1440p, 1600x, GTX 1080, 16gb RAM@3200, and I'm pretty steady at 40 - 45 fps during them with everything turned to 'ultra'.

I would like to thank Creative Assembly on listening to the Community's Feedbacks and Suggestions during it's delays, for the list of things they did during the delays please check here

https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/bqwhyh/massive_appreciation_for_ca_on_listening_to_the/ 

I have been following CA and following all 3K's content since launch, and also have written feedback and suggestions for the game, most of the issues and concerns were fixed during the delays of the game, CA have also responded to my issues and addressed them, the game is in a much more polished state compared to Rome 2 

The Developers also have streams over 30+ hours of content on their Total War Live Channel, as well as hours and hours of gameplay available from content creators. Unlike in Rome 2 where we only saw a trailer and some battle that's it

The delayed have proved to have done the game justice, thank you so much to CA for listening to the fans
