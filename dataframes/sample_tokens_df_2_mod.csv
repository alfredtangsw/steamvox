3246,Content & Authenticity,"Historical Total War meets fantasy in a relatively unique and underrepresented setting in the Strategy genre. A return to form from the somewhat over-simplified mechanics of past titles, Total War: Three Kingdoms sits in the middle ground between accessibility to newcomers and interesting nuance for veterans. Although slightly one-dimensional similar to the setting in Shogun II, the aesthetic and improvements to the game, along with unique mechanics bring out the true character of the game.

TW:3K takes many nods from Paradox games, to deliver an interesting campaign never seen before in the Total War series. Diplomacy and kingdom management are real options and can serve as a huge challenge: you will lose if you don't deal with it properly.

Mod support is coming and modders are already putting out content and fixes for the game, so even if Creative Assembly drop the ball with some balancing or content, modders could step in. Modding has always been a core part of the franchise that has been somewhat neglected recently, so hopefully there is breadth for them to add and improve to the game more this time round.

Overall, TW:3K unique enough in its aesthetic and mechanics to feel like a completely different game, yet incorporates aspects of historical and fantasy titles in a functional way.

351,Tactical Gameplay,"Before I start I would like to say this is my first total war game, I'm also Chinese but I will leave the review in English both as a practice to my writing but also I feel like it might be interesting to portray my thoughts to people from a different culture about a game that takes place on my homeland. 

The gameplay is addicting and captivating to strategy game fans that makes you say ""One more turn before bed"" to yourself constantly. One of the very first video game I touched was Starcraft 2 back in 2010, so I really enjoy the fact that there are real time combat in a turn based strategy game, it feels refreshing after playing SC2 for years and hundreds hours of Civilization.

I also really really enjoy the music, there are not many tracks which is a downside, but I absolutely love how they did the music. Here is one of my favorite piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MYAzRwrscQ The music make use of several ancient Chinese instrument and weaves them together into a beautiful masterpiece.

The overall visual is very beautiful to look at, not stunning, but really easy on the eyes, the campaign map of China uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers, land and trees, not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at, there are also peasants working on the fields, soldiers patrolling the main road,  pandas eating bamboos, and hunters hunting wild animals. making the entire map feel alive, small details goes a long way.

Now let me talk about something I feel is lacking about this game:

First off, the multiplayer is somewhat lacking, when I play a co-op match, even after I signed the shared victory treaty I still can't reinforce my partner's army, I have to wait till I rank up to form a coalition to be able to do so, doing so makes the fact that the first half of a co-op game is just minding their own business, it's worse that sometimes you won't be able to see each other for a good 50 turns if you pick two factions that have distant starting locations.

Also, the community manager is really full of herself, at least on reddit which is the platform I use, yes, Grace, I'm talking about you, what kind of community manager would threaten a community that they will not respond anymore if users post threads they don't like? This caused a massive drama on the subreddit and I feel it is very unprofessional for a community manager to do so.

2955,"UX/UI, Performance, Stability","For years I've been asking for a game that merges the depth of Paradox grand strategy and the battles of TW. I think we are finally close to that dream here. 
The campaign depth in TWTK is really impressive and quite surprising for TW as I've felt like CA have tried to dumb things down in the past (ironically it's Paradox that has done this with their latest release). 
The battles look great and again surprised me. The preview videos didn't impress me at all as the battles seemed too bright and cartoon/mobile game like. But once I got the game into my hands, set the unit scale to extreme, removed arrow trails and changed the colour profile to ""records"" instead of ""romance"" I loved them.
Pros:
- campaign depth, many decisions to make.
- AI doesn't spam armies (from what I've experienced so far)
- Artstyle and graphics. They haven't gone crazy with the artstyle and its grounded in history which I love. No bulky Warcraft armour here :) 
- character interaction.
- seems quite optimized.
- loading screens are very brief (I'm using SSD) and have audio and visual narration which makes them less of a chore.
- lots of options to change the game and UI to your preferences. 
- Great tutorials. F1 highlights all buttons on the screen and explains them making it very easy to understand everything 

Cons:
- Battles are far to quick for my taste. Mods will address this.
- Not a huge fan of having 3 retinues in an army but I understand why they have them as it's much more character based than previous titles.

1123,Content & Authenticity,"Background (CAN SKIP IF YOU WANT): Total War: Three Kingdoms has been a hype train for me since Medieval II: Total War's Three Kingdoms mod. So I have quite the history in terms of being biased toward this title (therefore, you can take a jug of salt and chug it down your throat if you want for this review) and I am a fan of this era (I am a Chinese after all...). This game has been quite the adventure for me as I have anxiously waited for so long for the release of the game with the mixed previews from game critics and total war communities in mind (i.e. people thought that this title would flop harder than Thrones of Britannia). Either way, I was skeptical for this release. However, I still believe in CA to release a decent product due to Warhammer I and II being quite well received. With all the emotions in mind, I approached this game with optimism when it was released and I wasn't completely disappointed. NOW BACK ON TO THE SHOW AND THANK YOU for listening to my soap opera.

Review: So Total War: 3K has been a excellent addition to the Total War franchise as it covers almost all different cultures and ethnicities in historical time period (*looking at Africa*). The game is probably one of the best optimized so far recently compared to the likes of Warhammer (Still could not finish my ME Kroq Gar campaign *sad) and it runs smooth like butter, so props for that. I love the artistic style they went for this game as it is fitting for the time period and culture (e.g. LITERAL technology tree, map layout, and UI). Now it is quite hard to summarize everything in a paragraph (and it is hard to read), so LET'S MAKE A PROS AND CONS LIST (everyone loves it):

PROS:
- Very well optimized (had one crash so far)
- Immersive art styles and graphics (though there's some things I want to touch on in terms of cons)
- Cool Dueling mechanics
- RPG mechanics (e.g. equiping characters with items, which allows for better attachment towards your characters)
- Selection between Historical and Romance Mode
- Diplomacy: OK I have to give this a thorough review, this is the first time that CA actually give in their effort to try to make diplomacy interesting and THEY DID. It is very interesting to see different mechanics being introduced (e.g. coalition, numerical values of signing agreements, unique faction actions like Cao Cao's proxy wars, etc.) and being well implemented since it is their first time attempting to improve diplomacy.
- Family tree and relationship development (though this is also a con in some ways)

Cons:
- Seems like a unfinished product as a lot of legendary/generic characters do not have unique protraits (e.g. Xun Yu, Xun You, Guo Jia, Huang Gai, Zhang He, etc.) and a lot of the characters in-game seems to be made up or doesn't exist in that era. In addition, I would believe CA would eventually release campaigns for different time frame during the Three Kingdoms Era as dlcs (e.g. Battle of Chibi, Battle of Guandu, Battle of Wuzhang Plains, etc.). I would wished they have release more of that during their postpone release of 3K.
- Battles: Alright... I have a mixed view of this topic as battles can be fun sometimes, but as you progress further into the campaign it became more dull as it is the same hammer and anvil strategy over and over again (though so variations exist AKA CHEESE). Either way, it is very enjoyable to see Zhang Fei and Lu Bu can take on a whole army by themselves, but that devalues the units you have in your army and they become quite useless sometimes (they are just eye candy MMM...). Siege battles are still the same as other total war games (NERF TOWERS PLS) and I would like to see improvements on that...
- UI: It is a lot of information thrown at you at once, so you get overwhelmed with the information presented, but if you spend sometime with it you'll get use to it. HOWEVER, there are some information that is very hard to find like how corruption is calculated (it doesn't really show that to you), and character relationship is a mess like spider webs. Idk how they going to fix this, but maybe mods or they will figure something out...

OVERALL: I really like this game and I want it to be successful (being Chinese and all that). Yes, this game has flaws, it is not a perfect game, but is it worth buying and playing? (That's up to you to decide, but I would suggest buying it on sale until they add more content and improve some areas, unless you are a fan of the era/dynasty warriors fans). So there you go, I apologize for the lengthy review, but this is the one that I care the most about... Either way THANK YOU AND SEE YOU ALL ON THE BATTLEFIELD!!!

Three Kingdoms, the age of heroes, when many great generals , strategists and political figures get on the stage of history to reshape the fate of China in countless battles. In East Asian, they treat this novel as a the Bible for Diplomatic and Tactical thinking. All countries in East Asian culture group : Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese love it. 

Japanese has successfully introduce this period to the West via Dynasty Warriors, Romance of Three Kingdoms and Kessen.

For any of you who's not familiar with the settings, the story happens during 3rd century in China. 

Han Empire , after almost 500 years of successful ruling human world  ( ancient China called their land as Tian Xia , or Great Country under the Heaven , and their Emperor is the one sent by God to rule the human world ), starts showing signs of weakness. Struggles for power in the Emperor Court lead to the establishment of 18 Warlords Coalition , leading by YuanShao against DongZhuo. Shortly after that, each warlords has their own ambitions and everyone want to seize power from the Emperor, get rid of the old and crumble Han Empire and start their own dynasties. From here, the story begins.

I was very excited when CA announced that they will make a Total War game cover this period. Many great improvements from other Total war tittles that have been successful rolling out in this game , yet there 're still some to improve

+Pros

Beautiful landscape  of ancient China is showed in World Map

Battles was added with Duel Mode, this never happen in other Total War before, great improvement from War hammer 2 when generals having their own space to fight with each other

Interesting Diplomacy system, if you want to survive in middle or end game, you should master it

Each Warlords have the own global strength to conquer the map

Creative recall / mustering feature that helps armies marching across the map within 3- 5 turns, it might take 20+ turn easily if this system not exist in late game


Good optimization, my game run smoothly in battles and turn end very fast 


+Con:

World map and Battle Map look like two different art styles, nothing related at all, I feel like they were created by two different team. World map show the beautiful and authenticity of ancient China in artistic way. Battle Map just like a copy paste from some old Total war game :

-Lack of mountain height. Remember in Rome 2, Shogun 2 or Medieval 2 where your unit were camping on top of super high mountains waiting for enemies to come for an ambush ? This 's not exist in Three Kingdoms, even the most mountainous region is Shu ( West of China, close to Himalaya ), Battle Map only show small little hills like a sand dune

-Grass look like coral , very cheap and lazy design , in the trailer it looks tall and thin :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UhSsPhIpqM

-Lack of tree showing Asian plants : only bamboo and cherry blossoms I 've seen so far . If removed those and the mountain afar, everything else looks like copy paste  directly from EU map . Asian pine tree was in Shogun 2 if I was correct but in here nowhere to be seen even in World Map there are a lots.

-The city walls looks comically short compare to any castles or cities in Rome 2 or Shogun 2

There was no naval battles


Poor sync animation for units fighting, I understand that Warhammer series each race have the downsizes so it's not comparable like Shogun 2 to add complex fighting animation ( in Warhammer 2 they added quite a few good one for units vs units ) . For Three Kingdoms its human vs. human too, and the fight was seriously lack of depth, most of the time you see units swinging in the air and the dude on other side just fall off the ground for no reason

The fighting animation look super cartoonish . Like something straight from Kungfu Panda, nothing like Rome 2 or Shogun 2. This due to the fact that they try to reduce the level of violent so they can sell the game in Chinese market, where it has more strict regulation rules, and it has proven successful when 300 millions copies were sold in May . I would like to see they adding more animations for mature audiences, even if it was DLC

Character design looks awful:

-GuanYu and ZhangFei are somewhat consist with other games and historic portraits. 

-Somehow they made Liubei 's nose extremely large for Asian face like an exaggerate version of Jackie Chan . 

-YuanShao a powerful warlord who leading a Coalition of 18 lords fighting agaisnt DongZuo and Lubu, instead of making him looks powerful and respectable, CA given him a looks that just like Po ( again, from Kunfu Panda ) yelling and whinning 24/7

-ZhugeLiang, the God of Wisdom in novel looks like an Asian drug dealer 

-Another one GanNing , yes he was a bandit in the novel, in game looks like a street robber

-CA only invest their time and effort in 20 famous generals. The rest looks super generics and borings. Will there be DLC to declone the rest of them ?


The UI looks confusing as fuck, took me almost 3 days to understand what's going on in my campaign

Unit design isn't that great, most units seems lack of strength and energy to fight:

- High tier unit with armors seems like they wearing something straight from Fallout serries

-There is no one pushing the Ram any more ? unlike other Total War games, this is a new level of laziness

Lack of recruitable generals in talent pool:

-I realize the most challenging thing is not economy or battles but the number of retinue you can hire at end game phase. I can have up to 16 stacks but due to continuous battles, only 7-12 stacks are available and the talent pool empty most of the time

Meanwhile my final opponents always at full stack even though he like 1/3 of my size, i used a spy and realize that he has like 15 - 30 generals are in line to be recruit so AI never run out of generals no matter how often you execute their generals at the end of battles

-Suggestion for developers:

Need  new DLC to declone generals and invest more in artstyle

Need new DLC to add more animations for all units in the fight, right now zoom in to see the fight looks super boring and General duels animations become repetitive after a while. Best advise is create new Game Engine to replace WarScape, it has been almost 20 years since Rome . Back then it was a major hit in gaming industry, now it become clunky when watching unit fights, may be CA could create something like Mount and Blade with better hitbox and smoother animations for the battles.

Need to invest more on unit design, like now units all have weird portion and very cartoonish looks compare to other Total War games

-Please have a looks at the following

Tiger Knights, my favorite game, unit looks pretty slick, clean design, more mature: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RutUOHn1MxQ

Rise of Three Kingdoms mod, from Medieval 2 , less cartoonish than this game :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3DCNXL43HQ


Group up news on World Map under different section like Economy, Diplomacy, Battles, etc. with small notification like a mail box so we can sort out each new we want to read. Currently in end game phase i have 20-30 news each turns stack on top of each other like block chain and it super hard to do mini click between each of them ( there is no Previous / Next message options ) 

Giving players option to reduce number of flags each armies unit carries

Allow us to select Subtitles for the game, I would like to understand what my armies saying in Chinese, just like watching a good Japanese samurai movie in Japanese, we need  Subtitles

Ranks behind shogun 2 for the best total war title
Personally i give it 9/10

Pros:
-diplomacy actually works
-dynamic campaign
-in depth character relationship
-Record mode for those who want more traditional total war gameplay

Cons:
-uninteresting and dull late game,i never complete a campaign.
Once i came close enough on my legendary Cao Cao playthrough but decided it was not worth the time.
-no settlement auto manage,managing all your commanderies at late game is a nightmare

I'm enjoying the hell out of this game and curious to see what CA gonna add in the future
One thing that all total war veteran really need right now is BlOOD AND GORE
release the blood dlc ASAP!! xd

2857,Tactical Gameplay,"Three kingdoms is a refreshing and polished total war game and a unique entry in the series.

I want to break down my review into different total war ""features"" and how 3K competes in each area.

1. Diplomacy - 20 / 10
I say this because three kingdoms has revolutionized the diplomacy system, in just countless ways. Not only does the AI make smarter, more believable decisions, there is a great improvement to the depth and intrigue in diplomacy. This has been the short leg on the total war table for literally 20 years at this point and it has finally been improved to create an engaging and immersive experience. You might not think diplomacy is all that interesting, but I think it very heavily impacts what KIND of wars you fight. You can actually make allies of your closest rivals and even influence diplomacy in unique ways with special characters like Cao Cao. In this way, diplomacy changes the total war playstyle less from a ""gobble up one enemy at a time"" sort of mechanic to more of an integrated system of loaylties and betrayals. Thats sounds super corny, but its really there.

2. Graphics - 9 / 10
Not the coolest unit models, but the graphical performance is the best the series has ever seen. I can use the extreme unit size (240 men per unit) with the highest graphical settings with no noticeable drop in FPS with my GTX980 intel i7 setup. Also, the unit model detail is less important considering just how stylized everything is. It perfectly complements the setting and the ""fantasy"" like feel to it, even when you play on records mode.

3. Campaign - 10 / 10
Not only are the different playable factions interesting and unique (Yes specific characters and factions DO have unique units, contrary to what some people seem to think), but I am finding myself much more interested in interesting generals and administrators beyond the previous systems, even in total war warhammer (where I admitedly built every character basically the exact same way to fit my playstyle). 

Also, another thing I don't see anyone talking about: You can split off generals from your armies to form detached armies!!!! People have been complaining that you get stuck with a big 20 stack that can't split its forces ever since Rome 2 and now you finally can do this again! Why would you do this? Lets say you invade an enemy territory with a full stack, and the enemy moves a small force out of their home region to counter attack you somewhere else. In the last 5 total war games you had to choose between using your 20 stack to chase down this raiding army (time consuming!!) or continuing on and attacking the enemy lands while yours get pillaged. No more! Now you can just detach one of your generals from the 20 stack and send him to chase down the raiders. Plus this should also massively aid the problem where the AI retreats from you endlessly if you outnumber them. Now you could just detach a general from your force (perhaps to act as a garrison temporarily) while your remaining 14 units engage the AI. 

3. Battles 8 / 10
I havent actually fought enough sieges and land battles to comment too much on this. Also, it seems like in romance mode, the ""battle"" is a total sideshow compared to duels which are more deterministic. You can easily just play records mode if you don't like this, and its honestly just as fun. Instead of powerful character abilities and duels to the death, you just use tactics to win the day. Definitely not as bad as some battles in some total war games, but it does need some balancing. Like for example ranged units not only have insane range on their weapons, they also just disintegrate units in seconds before running out of ammo. To counter this, ranged units have like 1/2 the health of melee troops which makes no sense to me... they get slaughtered by the bucket load when you hit them with even light cavalry. 

However another thing I dont see people talking about is the combination units. You now have units that actaully have multiple weapon loadouts opperating in tandem. Also every unit has gorgeous flags flying in the wind carried by actual soldiers!! Remember med 2 when there were floating flags?? Yes now we actually have flag bearers. And these mechanics are totally open for modders to use to make all sorts of combo units, perhaps with sword champions leading regiments or making more diverse general's bodyguards.

4. UI: 10 / 10
Very solid. Pretty to look at, but super useful and easy to learn. I also love the almost ""mobile game"" style buildings and unit card portraits.

5. Naval warfare 0 / 10
This is a bummer because chinese naval combat fighting RIVER BATTLES would be probably the coolest thing you could add to this game. I've always wanted to see river battles with limited width rivers, varying tides and currents affecting combat... better luck next time i guess.

2849,Tactical Gameplay,"Pros
+Very good looking, nice music, characters very recognisable from the source material.
+Large variety of factions with different challenges and playstyle recommendations, kudos for this, a more pedestrian effort would have just made the main 3 (Wei Wu and Shu) playable.
+Options for both more traditional style game (records) and more epic/heroic style game (romance). Kudos for this, it even affects the visuals, as records is more historically accurate, romance more fantastical.
+AI seems to have quite different personalities depending on the characters and faction.
+Better late game than in previous titles, the AI tends to blob up (and split apart) more like you might see in a paradox game, and there's usually a challenge to be had toward the late game, as someone in the other half of the map has done the same thing you have.
+Agents have essentially gone, though the intel gathering aspect is managed through a spying sub mechanic.

Cons
-Majority of factions are surrounded by potential enemies, and most of the territory you'll lose in this game will be because you're fighting a several front war and can't be everywhere at once.
-Further more to this, armies seem to take a very long time to get around the map, and you'll do a lot of fighting against enemies where you're essentially ""swapping"" territory as you are both attacking the vast areas that you each can't defend. Both of these are extremely frustrating
-Replenishment in the early game is very slow, and you're likely to be sitting there a long time waiting for units to replenish. Building armies is a lot, lot slower than in total war warhammer, and recovering unit strength is slower still. This makes it exponentially more difficult when you're fighting more than one faction at once.
-Very high price point for the game at the moment.
-High population causes negative happiness/public order, this is a bugbear that has come back from earlier games. It feels a bit stupid to upgrade a city to get more slots, only to have to use these slots on happiness buildings as bigger cities have more pop and therefore a bigger happiness debuff. I'm sure this will soon be fixable with a mod.

Mixed or opinion elements
+/- Much more complicated building and province management. In total war Warhammer there's usually just one building for income, for example, here there are tons, and income is divided into different types, and you have to build support buildings that give a +% to certain types of income. You can appoint governors and send people on assignments. Some people are going to like this intricate sort of micromanagement, but I really don't and prefer the simpler buildings/provinces from Warhammer.
+/- Army construction is different, rather than a general (or lord, depending on what other game you're comparing) your army is composed of up to three characters, each of whom has up to six units following them (their retinue). Certain characters give better buffs to certain units, and some units are exclusive to certain character types. A plus for trying to be historically accurate (this was the age of warlords). In my opinion though, this system is more trouble than it's worth, and would prefer just to be able to recruit a stack of units like in the olden days.
+/- Role playing elements. Characters need to be satisfied (this is quite hard early game, very easy later on), and can have friendships and rivalries with others. If you've played the ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" series, it's the same idea. However, there are a lot of random events that spring up, and some give pretty bad consequences, -as it's random, you can't mitigate or prepare for it, really, it just means be prepared to reload a lot. Overall I would say that the relationships and satisfaction element is more trouble than it's worth, and the whole characters system is something I'd rather I could switch off, particularly as you have to pay all these characters a wage.
+/- Big and complicated diplomacy system that is also vitally important. There are a lot of UI improvements over previous games, but diplomacy is much more important in this title, and is almost overwhelming. Ancient warlords hired wise fellows whose job it was to keep track of alliances, vassals and grudges, and halfway through a campaign you'll feel like you'll want to do the same thing.


Please Note that as of the time of writing this there are still bugs, but I'm pretty sure these will eventually be fixed. For example, I've noticed armies sometimes just don't reinforce each other for seemingly no reason, and it's possible for armies to just walk in and out of cities that are under siege (those sentries must be useless). There were a few problems earlier on with Yuan Shao vassalizing everyone, but this seems to have stopped. Some people are complaining that towers are overpowered, but I haven't noticed this yet.

TL/DR
This is a good game, and with mods/more development it's going to be even better. I don't find it as much ""fun"" as total war warhammer, which is more focused on constantly and quickly pushing armies together, but this is pretty good. I was going to not recommend and say definitely get this game but wait for the price to come down, but on second thoughts that just feels a little cheap. This is probably one of the much more involved and challenging total war games, but if you're up for that, get the game when the price feels right for you, either now or in a year's time.

3325,Content & Authenticity,"So after roughly 5 playthroughs on VH difficulty I would say this TW game is perfect in almost every way. I have played every other title extensively and this game definitely took all the best from every world and put it into this one.

But it was one major game breaking flaw: No replayability.

The campaign(whether you play Romance or Records) is story driven. This means that AI, though incredibly intelligent, will always play the same way and that the endgame of every campaign will virtually be the same. The only difference is based on how you play. For example, if you play any northern kingdom(outlaws, Gongsun zan, zhao yung, etc) the kingdom of Wu, in the south, will always rise and be the most powerful kingdom in the land. But say you play as Cao Cao or Sun Jian, Kingdom of Song will always rise in the north and probably vassalize Dong Li(or whoever the successor may be). The game is designed to support the rise of the ""three kingdoms"" and I get that, but once you've fought it once, its not any different the second time around. It also doesn't help that, save for the yellow turban rebellion, all the factions play the same way, with slight perk and unit differential. 

I know that these issues will be addressed and fixed with coming DLC and patches, but its worth mentioning in its state now. This is probably the best TW title to date, and being someone who has an average of 500 hours per game, I'd like to be able to play it again and rack up even more. Just cant right now.

2577,Tactical Gameplay,"i've played different total war titles from RomeTW, M2TW, Shogun2TW, Rome2TW, Attila, a bit of WH 1 on my cousin's account, and now this.

imo, this game could be considered as one of the best title in the franchise.

pros:
- Deeper, more exciting diplomatic system with lots of tools you can use and AI works quite good with it (compared to previous titles where AI can declare war, break alliances and didn't do????????????in alliance)

- Good optimization compared to other titles

- Better ui overal with color code implemented to things like unit, buildings, etc making you able to better understand what compliment what. 

- Deeper emphasize on characters (especially on romance mode)

- oh and ambush battle is actually tense and escaping is actually an option now, not just like regular battle

cons:
- no sync animation (or only rare) and combat happen too fast or arcadey unlike in previous titles (even tho tbh this grow on me eventually and now i dont really mind it)

- Ai still use cheat to help them sadly, even tho AI isn't that bad imo (see my later point)

neutral?
- Graphics as you can see is a bit different compared to previous historical title. it got some style to it

- New mechanics or micromanagement you can do to optimize your commandery/settlement in different ways. i don't really care or mind this too much tbh so you can ignore it or do it if you like micromanage everything

- AI in this title has some improvement compared to previous recent titles. In land battle, they will wait for reinforcement if it's an option. AI will now actually attack and come for you if they are the one who did that on the map and will defend if you are the one attacking, even tho in land battle they could also move up if they aren't greatly outnumbered. They use their cav to flank us so thats good too. In romance, they are smart enough to deny duel where the odds really against them.

- Map looks beautiful imo. this depends on personal taste really but for me it's good. btw did you know theres up to 10 level of settlement and there's various maps for different location like mine, farm land, etc?",0.704100013,"['total_war_titles', 'rometw', 'rome2tw', 'attila', 'cousin', 'one_best', 'title', 'franchise', 'pro', 'tool', 'compared_previous_titles', 'declare_war', 'break', 'alliance', 'alliance', 'optimization', 'title', 'color', 'code', 'unit', 'building', 'compliment', 'emphasize', 'character', 'romance_mode', 'ambush', 'battle', 'option', 'battle', 'animation', 'combat', 'arcadey', 'unlike_previous', 'title', 'tbh', 'use', 'cheat', 'help', 'graphic', 'compared_previous', 'historical_title', 'style', 'new_mechanics', 'micromanagement', 'optimize', 'commandery', 'settlement', 'different_ways', 'mind', 'ignore', 'micromanage', 'title', 'improvement', 'compared_previous', 'recent_titles', 'land', 'battle', 'reinforcement', 'option', 'map', 'defend', 'tho', 'land', 'battle', 'use', 'flank', 'romance', 'deny', 'duel', 'odd', 'looks_beautiful', 'imo', 'taste', 'level', 'settlement', 'map', 'location', 'farm', 'land']",79,"['title', 'micromanage', 'use', 'romance_mode', 'commandery', 'mind', 'building', 'reinforcement', 'attila', 'land', 'cousin', 'optimize', 'declare_war', 'micromanagement', 'help', 'tho', 'flank', 'settlement', 'location', 'deny', 'animation', 'improvement', 'tbh', 'option', 'rome2tw', 'arcadey', 'defend', 'style', 'emphasize', 'ignore', 'pro', 'level', 'one_best', 'compliment', 'compared_previous', 'optimization', 'new_mechanics', 'taste', 'compared_previous_titles', 'looks_beautiful', 'historical_title', 'different_ways', 'farm', 'unit', 'franchise', 'battle', 'duel', 'character', 'total_war_titles', 'break', 'graphic', 'ambush', 'recent_titles', 'romance', 'code', 'imo', 'map', 'rometw', 'unlike_previous', 'odd', 'tool', 'color', 'alliance', 'combat', 'cheat']",65,"unit, battle, faction, army, general, character, diplomacy, campaign, hero, building",1

3274,Tactical Gameplay,"From what I have played so far, this is the best Total War game yet. All of the mechanics have been improved from previous titles in the series, I'll list some notable examples below - 

If a unit is entirely destroyed in a battle, it doesn't delete the unit on the campaign map. It just makes them unavailable for a turn or two then they can replenish back to full strength over time. Also units can be recruited to generals anywhere once unlocked, so you no longer have the issue of not being able to recruit your elite units unless you are in a super developed province like in older titles.

Diplomacy exists! You can now trade territories, the AI actually accepts reasonable peace deals, you can more easily trade surpluses in one resource for another (like food for gold, or ancillaries for non-aggression pacts). This enables you to build a web of alliances if you want to help take down larger opponents. 

The battles have had numerous UI improvements to make everything much easier to see in the middle of combat. Units have an icon with a draining circle to show morale that also shows what type of unit they are. Generals can also duel, and the option gives a brief rundown of your general's odds if they accept the duel. You can also automatically decline duels if you don't want this popping up mid-fight. I will say it can be a tad tough to select the right unit in the middle of a packed brawl, but that's really my only complaint.

The building and tech systems are far more in depth than previous titles. You can make specialized food production settlements, or border provinces with larger garrisons as needed (which will be needed in a lot of the starting positions). 

The battle AI has also been improved. Enemy armies will actively try to prevent rear charges from your cavalry, I have had several occasions where a spear unit moved along with my cavalry to protect other units that were engaged in a fight. Enemy units will also use formations to reduce missile damage while charging in, and the AI will use generals according to their abilities.

Overall I love this game as my play time since launch should attest to.

1474,Tactical Gameplay,"Three Kingdoms is my first Total War game, so I can't make any comments about how it stacks up in the series. I can tell you that, as someone who read Romance of the Three Kingdoms, this game impressed the hell out of me. The attention to detail is astounding. For the most part, the warlords act the way they were portrayed in the novel - Cao Cao the devious manipulator, Lu Bu the ludicrously strong warrior, Liu Bei the virtuous scion of the Han, etc. Characters in general comprise a large part of the gameplay. Their personalities affect their relationships with the people they work and fight alongside, which impart bonuses or debuffs. I found myself paying attention to even my generic characters, assembling teams that would jive well and lay waste to enemies.

Combat looks amazing. You've got large armies with different units clashing and generals dueling it out one-on-one, all on beautiful maps with terrain advantages and disadvantages. You can ambush enemies from the forest. You can lay siege to a city and rain flaming artillery onto the defending peasants. I encourage everyone to zoom in with the camera and see the carnage up-close if you're winning a battle and it makes no difference whether you're commanding well or not. Just take the visuals in. They're spectacular.

Let's get into some negatives. Campaign movement in this game is BS. I've had the game decide that my generals need to take 5 turns to move a few inches forward on the campaign map while the enemy runs around with impunity. Chasing the enemy around the campaign map gets really old really fast. Diplomacy also needs some tweaking. I was once best friends with another faction and at war with a third faction. The first faction decided to vassalize the second faction and all of a sudden they hate me because I had a war with one of their vassals. Speaking of vassalization, the AI vassalizes much easier compared to the player. A game about a bunch of factions all vying against one another feels more like a game where a bunch of factions are all united against you.

Also, remember how character personalities and relationships are important? Cue 2 of my characters, who are best friends, suddenly gain some random traits that make them despise each other. Zheng Jiang and Lu Zheng, sworn sisters, started hating each other at around turn 3 in my campaign. Oh and Zheng Jiang randomly got injured hunting while invading an enemy city so she couldn't fight in the siege. 

Finally, spies are FUCKING USELESS. I don't know how people have gotten any use out of them. Mine get recruited and defect 10 turns later (but their satisfaction just happens to drop like a rock right AFTER they defect). Every. Time.

So sometimes the game can be infuriating, but the positives unequivocally outweigh the negatives.

2208,Tactical Gameplay,"Where to begin, well, allow me to qualify this by saying: if you liked the Warhammer titles I think you'll like this, it doesn't have the same kind of unit variety, but; quick battles, ""unique"" individual faction mechanics, and powerful legendary characters set a decent similarity.

Now, admittedly, the game does have some good stuff going for it, even by Historical title standards;
-a more translucent diplomacy AI, you can see quite obviously how everyone will react and what is required for diplomacy.
-Food supplies have been updated since Thrones of Brittania and can now be traded in diplomatic agreements.
-A supply system indicates how long your armies can operate outside of your regions
-Expanded diplomatic options, I particularly like the Coalitions as you get groups of factions allied.
-And my favorite, siege battles follow in the form of Thrones in that they are actually effective to get around and fun to play.

However, it definitely pales in comparison to other aspects of the Historical titles, such as Rome II and Shogun II;
-As mentioned, battles play similarly to Warhammer - though the battle maps are larger than the aforementioned and sieges are fleshed out.
-Despite enhanced understanding of AI in diplomacy it is still just as likely to turn on you 180 degrees if you're not fighting someone.
-You need to have a border with other factions to form a trade agreement, but that border has to connect to your capitol, the game doesn't tell you this, but if you advance past your borders and leapfrog an ally for a non-continuous border you can't negotiate with the people beyond that unless that territory happened to be a port.
-you can't bring military supplies to your armies besieging a city, which doesn't make sense, why can't I resupply the besieging army with an army fully supplied?
-Internal politics are inferior to that of Rome II and Attila in that there are no opposing political parties, throughout most of the game you are limited in terms of the number of government positions and yet will continue to get disloyal characters demanding a nonexistent seat in the government.
-Character relations, though an interesting idea, are poorly implemented. My wife - who I start off married to as Gongsun Zan - may be put in charge as a general in the same army and yet she despises her husband from the get go. Similarly, you can start off on positive relations, but two characters can develop differing personalities and now two generals who have been fighting side by side for ages hate each other.
-And finally, records mode, thee historical non-Romanticized play version is just as bad as Romance in terms of General strength if not more so and clearly wasn't given the same kind of love and attention that they put into Romance.

Honestly if you're interested in Historical total war titles that actually require some strategy to play get Rome II or Shogun II if you haven't already. I may not have a lot of hours in the game and it's not going to rise quickly, but the game just isn't inspiring or interesting enough to warrant playing continuously the way I can past titles.",0.708100021,"['qualify', 'warhammer_titles', 'unit_variety', 'battle', 'faction', 'mechanic', 'legendary_characters', 'similarity', 'stuff', 'historical_title', 'standard', 'diplomacy', 'diplomacy', 'food', 'supply', 'thrones_brittania', 'agreement', 'supply', 'army', 'region', 'diplomatic_options', 'coalition', 'group', 'faction', 'siege_battles', 'form', 'throne', 'comparison', 'historical_titles', 'rome_two', 'shogun_two', 'battle', 'battle_maps', 'siege', 'understanding', 'diplomacy', 'turn', 'degree', 'border', 'faction', 'trade_agreement', 'border', 'connect', 'capitol', 'advance', 'border', 'leapfrog', 'ally', 'border', 'people', 'territory', 'port', 'supply', 'army', 'city', 'sense', 'army', 'army', 'politic', 'rome_two_attila', 'party', 'term', 'number', 'government', 'position', 'character', 'seat', 'government', 'character_relations', 'idea', 'wife', 'gongsun_zan', 'charge', 'army', 'despis', 'husband', 'relation', 'character', 'personality', 'general', 'age', 'records_mode', 'version', 'romance', 'term', 'strength', 'attention', 'romance', 'total_war_titles', 'strategy', 'rome_two', 'shogun_two', 'rise', 'way', 'title']",95,"['mechanic', 'turn', 'title', 'rome_two', 'siege', 'advance', 'charge', 'legendary_characters', 'personality', 'agreement', 'version', 'diplomatic_options', 'shogun_two', 'strategy', 'government', 'politic', 'border', 'position', 'faction', 'historical_titles', 'husband', 'general', 'way', 'thrones_brittania', 'seat', 'term', 'region', 'party', 'rise', 'despis', 'degree', 'supply', 'similarity', 'qualify', 'group', 'ally', 'city', 'unit_variety', 'port', 'people', 'rome_two_attila', 'wife', 'standard', 'strength', 'number', 'army', 'diplomacy', 'understanding', 'historical_title', 'leapfrog', 'character_relations', 'form', 'gongsun_zan', 'age', 'battle', 'battle_maps', 'capitol', 'territory', 'warhammer_titles', 'trade_agreement', 'character', 'total_war_titles', 'romance', 'siege_battles', 'throne', 'idea', 'coalition', 'relation', 'attention', 'sense', 'connect', 'food', 'records_mode', 'stuff', 'comparison']",75,"unit, battle, faction, army, general, character, diplomacy, campaign, hero, building",1

2016,Characters,"The game itself is pretty enjoyable and it saddens me to write this negative review but I feel I must for the mistakes that were made. At the time of this review, there are many issues with the game which take away much of the experience for me, but I want to focus on four of them:

1. You cannot marry between factions more than once. They AI may purpose a second marriage but the terms are set and you cannot alter them. This means if you want more that one character or want to ensure a strong relationship over the years, tough luck, CA decided for no legit reason that you can't.
Edit: turns out you CAN do it more than once, but it takes some trickery. First you have to IMMEDIATELY divorce the character you just got, don't give them a chance to have kids. Then promote them 3-4 times so they don't get pissed and leave because this just happened to them. Then you can get another. The reasoning by the game engine is that if someone from one family is present in another, they can't marry in because everyone is related, even though only one character is blood related.

2. Ancient Chinese Cheetah-men. By this I mean they decided that charging infantry can chase down fleeing horses. Now if the horses are in red fatigue and it's over a short distance, I can understand. But yellow fatigue horses being chased down for over 3 minutes? NO, stupid dumb and limits the use of cav because if the player is smart, their first charge is their last, in which case, why bother with a 1 shot unit when I can deploy glaives?

3. Abysmal character event rates. For those who don't already know, No faction starts with more than 3 unique (those with portraits and armor) characters (Sun family not really being an exception because all 3 are kids at the start). This is ok, but characters who are suppose to join your faction, or who were suppose to already be serving according to history, are set by ""random events"" to join you without hassle. What does this mean? It means Dian Wei might never join Cao Cao, despite the fact that he was scooped up by him before the battle of Hu Lao gate. Now when I say might, I mean WILL, because the trigger rate for these events is something crazy low, possibly less than 1% (250/50000 according to a reddit poster). This is very annoying, and it leads to some characters not appearing in most campaigns, leaving one to wonder why CA even bothered besides to make people like me angry?

4. Most damning is the aging system (to clarify, I much prefer romantic mode). Of course characters should grow old and eventually die, this isn't warhammer anymore. But all unique characters are in the game from turn 1, meaning there's a set amount of time before china is filled with generic losers who just aren't fun to play as because all the uniques die of old age. This could be EASILY solved if they decided to include more characters from the later ages like Wen Yang, but they chose not to. Every time I stop expanding to develop my lands, time flies by and characters who were in their 40's are now dying of old age. There is only Sun Ren who is almost guaranteed to survive until the end, and that's because she's 1 at the start of the game and isn't useable until turn 85. It's because of her that I have problem 1 in the first place because I want all the Sun kids so I have interesting generals for most of my campaign, instead of generic portrait 7 in the late game.",0.530499995,"['sadden', 'review', 'mistake', 'review', 'issue', 'experience', 'marry', 'faction', 'purpose', 'marriage', 'term', 'alter', 'mean', 'character', 'relationship', 'year', 'luck', 'reason', 'edit', 'trickery', 'divorce', 'character', 'chance', 'kid', 'three_times', 'reasoning', 'engine', 'family', 'present', 'marry', 'character', 'blood', 'ancient_chinese', 'cheetah', 'man', 'infantry', 'chase', 'horse', 'horse', 'fatigue', 'distance', 'fatigue', 'horse', 'minute', 'limit', 'player', 'charge', 'case', 'bother', 'unit', 'glaif', 'character', 'event', 'rate', 'faction', 'unique_portraits', 'armor', 'character', 'family', 'exception', 'kid', 'character', 'faction', 'history', 'event', 'hassle', 'dian', 'wei', 'cao_cao', 'fact', 'battle', 'lao', 'gate', 'trigger', 'rate', 'event', 'low', 'reddit', 'poster', 'character', 'campaign', 'wonder', 'people', 'aging', 'clarify', 'mode', 'course', 'character', 'unique_characters', 'meaning', 'china', 'loser', 'unique', 'die_old_age', 'character', 'land', 'character', 'old_age', 'sun_ren', 'end', 'start', 'turn', 'problem', 'place', 'sun', 'kid', 'general', 'portrait']",108,"['low', 'charge', 'year', 'campaign', 'unique', 'mode', 'mistake', 'chase', 'term', 'sun', 'history', 'man', 'limit', 'cao_cao', 'gate', 'three_times', 'wei', 'glaif', 'cheetah', 'old_age', 'armor', 'purpose', 'problem', 'luck', 'chance', 'land', 'sun_ren', 'bother', 'unique_characters', 'china', 'general', 'hassle', 'dian', 'end', 'review', 'place', 'relationship', 'kid', 'rate', 'mean', 'edit', 'family', 'infantry', 'alter', 'engine', 'ancient_chinese', 'meaning', 'issue', 'exception', 'blood', 'turn', 'present', 'distance', 'unique_portraits', 'horse', 'poster', 'die_old_age', 'lao', 'faction', 'marriage', 'portrait', 'start', 'people', 'reddit', 'unit', 'trickery', 'fatigue', 'aging', 'wonder', 'event', 'trigger', 'marry', 'reason', 'loser', 'case', 'minute', 'course', 'battle', 'clarify', 'fact', 'divorce', 'reasoning', 'character', 'experience', 'sadden', 'player']",86,"china, war, cao_cao, lu_bu, liu_bei, yuan_shao, army, character, man, emperor",1

2355,Tactical Gameplay,"are you kidding me? This game is comeplete shit.. the horses are fucking slow as shit I might as well dismount them.. they are only good in their initial charge and gg... everyone gets exhausted after a 50m run.. There is just so much clutter on the hud its ridiculous even after i turn off a bunch of it. The troop comparison doesnt even make sense.. its so hard to compare them.. they have symbols to explain their armor and stuff when a new person to this game would get lost... I DID.. It just does not make sense of how Accessing a new level 4 building for farming gives me better spear units? or trading building allows me to get better archers? Apparently I don't even need a military barracks anywhere amongst my kingdom.. When you are at the cherry blossom tree getting new REFORMS.. They show me the fucking building instead of the name like WTF how the fuck u expect me to know what the specific building I want? I dont want to have to right click the shit in the map hud then click on the building that I need (thats locked) then it would lead me to the correct technology I need.

The Combat is even worse... Its so messy, Slow, hard to see, does not even make sense.. When they are already in combat. then I want them to push again to get tighter to avoid missile damage they dont even move.. In Rome Total War 2 the combat was amazing and clean and I can move troops through the broken lines of battle and flank easier..  In all other total war games Calvary is either very weak but super strong at flanks.. yes.. But in Three Kingdoms, when the horses are stuck in a infantry unit fighting, and you have archers shooting at the cavalry it has 0 effect. Super weak might as well throw the bow.. In all other Total War when the cavalry is in combat archers, slingers, javelins, skirmishers can kill them in seconds without even telling them to aim specifically for the Cavalry... because why? a dude on a horse sticks out like a sore thumb in a crowd of infantry.. 

Diplomacy took a while to understand.. not good, clutter on the screen, so many fucking names, and THE NAMES CHANGE WHEN THE LEADER DIES....  Might as well drop a beat and start saying all the leaders names and I might just make it on the top leader boards for country album..  And the Pictures change too ridiculous..  Alliances are bull shit, they jump side to side... Honestly I dont even know who I am attacking.. I see red borders, I send in the troops...

Only few things that are cool imo.. 
1. Huge map, great already conquered 1/3 of it on very hard difficulty
2. Armors and weapons for generals
3. We got the fucking power rangers with us coloring
4. Some more of the diplomacy option, turns, trading etc.
5. Thats about it. 

Of course no blood at all, The combat is so messy I cant even press insert to watch my men fight, and see sick animations like how I did in Rome Total War.  The units all looks 98% the same Boring,

-Immersive game world
-rich narative driven historical setting
-based on one of the oldest novels ever
-it's actually fucking well optimised. A total war game that's well optimised. Never thought i'd see the day.
-It looks good, and it knows where to cut corners to make it run well. 
-this is the first tw game to launch with an above 70% score since shogun 2
-you can send three dudes in to kill everyone
-you can play like a normal total war game with a general leading an army.
-you can play with a new mode that makes your characters superhuman as if they were from the romance novels. 
-I love this game, and i loved rome 2 at launch, hell i've got 1400 hours in that damn hellhole bugs and all. 
-no landship bug. 

now for some problems because nothing is perfect. 

-pathing can be a bit iffy.
-i miss matched combat.
-the economy system can feel a bit harsh sometimes.
-it still suffers the old alt+tab bugs of yestergames 
-it doesn't take much for a warlord to steamroll over other ai. 

honestly i want to have more negative to say else this feels too biased, but i genuinely cannot find too many faults in this game. I love it and i'm not even the biggest fan of CA's newer TW titles. Thrones and both warhammers were ok, but somehow they combined the two and made this masterpiece.

432,Tactical Gameplay,"There's something primal about the human need to conquer. The Total War franchise since the beginning has smelted that need to conquer into a smooth, cohesive experience. From Medieval times to the Three Kingdoms era, the formula has not really changed, and I love it. You take cities, accrue wealth, and build your armies for war.
In this latest iteration of Total War, you play as various factions of the Three Kingdoms era, a time where war was waged purely for the pursuit of unification and power. Take the field as the legendary Cao Cao or Liu Bei, and watch as your generals duel enemies on the field of battle. It may take time, but as you play, you slowly begin eating up other factions or vassalizing them.
Use diplomacy or strategy to slowly take over your enemies, but you have to be careful. If you make too many enemies, you may find yourself surrounded with not enough resources to battle everyone. Making smart choices with alliances or non-aggression pacts are the key to overcoming all obstacles. That being said, I had a really good time with the game but it did make me miss actual diplomacy trees, and not just the simplified version that Total War includes. I wish there was more to the game past the blind raging warfare that you wage, but that's not what this game is. Total War Three Kingdoms is a game that allows for players to strategically take their opponents down while dabbling in basic diplomatic skills. 
The game did crash every so often, but I can't tell if it was my PC just shutting the program down or if it was the client. Thankfully, auto-saving happens, and I never lost much progress.

2808,Content & Authenticity,"I have played every Total minus the Warhammer titles and the original Shogun. This is by far my favorite! For long-time Total War players the feel is that, they finally integrated the things that made Rome and both Medieval titles with the way they tried to do Empires thru Rome:2. (Atilla was an improvement on Rome:2's style imo). With diplomacy playing a huge role, but also having battle field actions have a massive impact on those diplomatic interactions. By simply besieging a settlement, you can turn alignments and treaties on end for rival factions (or your own lol). Very historically accurate as far as most believe, history of course is open to interpretation. The game does change, weather or not key events like Sun Jian's handing over of the Seal or Cao Cao' father's and Dong Zhou's assassinations, based on the events going on around them at the appropriate time. 

On the battlefield the controls are responsive, but at the same time units do what they ""think"" you want (kind of like commanding real units). Overall battle is very enjoyable similar to the way i felt about battle in the second thru fourth entries in the series, (Medieval, Rome, Medieval 2), with the added elements from later titles integrated flawlessly to create a new, yet familiar feel to combat. AND THERE ARE DUELS DURING COMBAT lol!! 

The visuals as expected are incredible. The picture pack is quite lacking with many famous characters sharing one basic picture per class. However many main characters have very well done personalized visuals. The Asian inspired sound track for the music is as expected. Voices are both great at times and very american sounding at others (very strange). Runs great, runs smooth under recommended settings on my above avg. Omen PC. Only 1 crash on over 40 hours of play and that was around 10 hours into a straight playthru (I attribute that to my PC lol).

HARD, even on easy you will find the game challenging if you are new or have been away for the past couple titles. I would say worth every penny of the 59.99+tax ticket. I would venture to say my hours spent in game will reach the thousands before the game becomes totally obsolete. Mind you I still play Total War: Rome from time to time and I believe that title is 15 years old or so. These games will make you feel like the leader of a historical faction and if you play the characters to their individual personalities they are incredible immersive. I recommend all Total War titles minus Rome 2 and Medieval as Medieval 2 and the original Rome are (imo) better representations of their eras.

I was really starting to get burnt out on Total War before I tried three kingdoms. It was always the same thing, the same exact strategies, just a constant steamroll. In 3K you have so many more options on how to conquer the map, thanks to the really good diplomacy system this time around. 

You wanna play for an economic victory? Do it. starve the enemy and feed them the solution, or amass your funds and use pure wealth to buy-out everyone smaller than you. 

Still like war-mongering? Do it. Rule through violence, or fear. Once you become powerful enough you can issue ultimatums to weaker nations, essentially forcing them to give in to your demands or else war will be declared. The more powerful you are, the better chance they'll submit.

Or you can be deceptive and manipulate everyone else into killing eachother. one faction in particular has the ability to start proxy wars and make other nations fight eachother without having to get dirty themselves.

looking forward to more DLCs to improve the game experience on historical stories, e.g. more real historical generals and factions, more special historical events.

there are also some aspects which can be modified to make the game follow the history line better, for example,
1. locking the visiting generals to the regions where they should be according to the history;
2. add more special characteristics to specified generals, like Guan Yu and Zhang Fei's absolute loyalty to Liu Bei rather than an incredible ez surrender after getting captured;
3. the marriage setting is so ridiculous, how could it be possible that a heir general like Sun Ce would join other faction provided that the faction pay some money or food to his father;
4. the military access setting is totally unfriendly to the player faction as those AI armies can move in your territories arbitrarily even without any diplomatic punishment.

Anyway, it's reeeally a very good game on the historical simulation of 3K.

3318,Strategic Gameplay,"Alright, Review time boyos. TLDR: Good game, some small gripes which i'll list below.

Pros:
-The overhaul of Generals is wonderful, they did a decent job at making them feel like they have wants, needs, desires, and ambitions and balancing these between in-faction characters and trying to pair up like minded generals is nice.
-Runs well,battles are smooth, campaign is smooth.
-pound for pound im pretty sure this is the largest TW map we've ever gotten with more settlements to conquer and strategic placement decisions to make than ever before
-Decent unit variety but could use some more

Neutral:
-Animations are a bit stiff but this is not an enormous concern for me
-Tech tree is pretty but hard to navigate at times and feels like its more trouble than its worth sometimes
-Very little faction diversity in the tech tree and building options
-Southern China is noticeably empty of starting factions, I would like to see some southern starting positions would make for an interesting dynamic since most of the key factions are up north.

Negative:
-Generals level up WAY too slowly, seeing as this is the main way you unlock higher-tier units especially your heavier infantry units this is a huge fucking problem for me heavy infantry is basically my bread and butter and I am end-game Gonsun Zan faction and still dont have heavy infantry which makes me IRRATIONALLY ANGRY
-Diplomacy received a much needed overhaul but ultimately fell flat and sometimes the AI is a little illogical.
-Espionage system basically has never worked for me in any regard other than scouting so I think a bump in favor of the player on the RNG is necessary.
-Absolutely HAVING to have a strategist in the army in order to make use of advanced formations, like such highly advanced tactics as ""lock your shields together guys"" as if a master strategist is what it takes to come up with such a plan. This for me temporarily pushes it over to a thumbs down until some of the issues ive mentioned are dealt with. I do honestly find this to be rather asinine and I think that Commanders at mid-high levels should unlock formations as well. 
-Only one faction has access to heavy infantry
-When I said southern china was empty I thought it was just no real playable factions starting down there, apparently its literally deserted down there.

For the most part I still highly recommend this game however after realizing another thing I find to be mechanically flawed and downright stupid with the game I have changed my review to a thumbs down until further notice. As patches come out I hope to see reasons to push this back to a thumbs up. Honestly between the General levelling being ridiculously slow paced after level 5 and absolutely HAVING to have a strategist in your army in order to use formations and not at least having one other general type that can use them I have to give it a negative review for now.

Cons
- Unique characters are at serious undersupply. At late game, all the uniques die out and the game gets much less dramatic.
- Could be a bit challenging for the beginners of Total War series in general. But man, this is always the case for any of the Total War titles.
- Reform (Tech) UI is beautiful, but it fails its most fundamental function of propagating information.
- Multiplayer is less intensive than TW: Warhammer 2.
Pros
- Absolutely fantastic optimization. Much faster than TW: Warhammer 2 despite all the graphics and stuff.
- Rarely for the TW series, no critical bugs even at the point of release. This was also the case for the TW: Warhammer series but hey, everybody expect bugs from a TW title since Rome 2, and TW has a infamy of becoming playable a year after release.
- TW: Warhammer-like Romance mode and Historical Records mode freely selectable
- The oriental-schemed graphics are absolutely beautiful.
- CA has finally perfected its diplomatic AI. AIs are incrdibly smart, almost being intimidating.
- Good balance between strategic settlement management and combat tactical management. TW: Rome 2 had too intense settlement management, while TW: Warhammer was too simplified.
- Historically accurate representation of political situation of China, where warlords aspire to be the emperor but nonetheless acknowledges the authority of the puppet emperor of Dong Zhuo.

TL;DR: Its really good.

3028,Tactical Gameplay,"One of the best Total War games in recent years. For veterans of the series, here are a few of the key differentiating features from the previous games;

[b]Characters[/b]
The character system has been massively revamped to something like a Crusader Kings-lite system. It works. Every character has their own ""satisfaction"" rating, and can develop relationships (positive and negative) with the others that they encounter. Every character has a class, and they can all be assigned in any capacity you like (generals, administrators, spies etc).

Furthermore, in ""Romance"" mode, characters are something akin to the Warhammer lords and heroes - individual, extremely powerful units, which I love (though you can choose to play on ""Records"" mode if that isnt your jam).

Also, there is an entirely reasonable system of equipment of different rarities etc. And I love that when you equip your general with say - a glaive, they will actually use that in the battles.

[b]Army Composition[/b]
Each army consists of up to 3 characters, and each character has their own retinue of up to 6 regular units. Many of the buffs characters receive will only apply to their retinue, not the whole army, so it makes sense to specialise; having a cavalry commander hitting the enemy flanks with his units, whilst your ""strategist"" sits at the back with the archers and artillery. Again, it works.

[b]Diplomacy[/b]
Diplomacy has received a long overdue overhaul, and is far better than in previous TW games. It appears CA have borrowed some of the best elements of the Paradox games - you can now see exactly what ""value"" the other party puts on each element of any proposed deal, and a breakdown of why they feel that way. The availability of information makes diplomacy much more flexible and enjoyable than previous games.

[b]Optimisation[/b]
A less glamorous point perhaps, but imagine my amazement when I hit the ""End Turn"" button, and within seconds I was back on my next turn. The game runs far better than a lot of previous ones have done at launch. Loading times and turn times are quick, I have yet to encounter a single bug. Its just generally a very polished game - kudos to CA.


These are what I would regard as the main new features compared with previous (especially historical) TW games. Overall it is a really solid entry and will I expect be the template for future TW games, and rightly so.

On an aside, isnt it funny that Imperator: Rome flopped massively due to it being seen as too much of a ""map painter"", whilst the newest Total War game has expanded upon pretty much everything [i]but[/i] the battle mechanics, and is doing well.

Well, at Rome 2, if you fight a force march army, they will force to fight a ambush battle which I consider as best counter to the bonus of force march. At Three Kingdom, the force marched army can retreat if they met any battle. Yes, you can never ever catch any force matched army since they move a further range, and retreat form any force trying to catch their tail. I have spent at least 10 turn and 2 forces to trace down the enemy when they finally reach till the end of the map. (thanks god they do have a limit on the size of the board).

Secondly, in Three Kingdom, you could actually move from one side of the rive to another within one turn move(through the shipping) Well, I have no idea why that river excite.

Furthermore, it feels like you are playing along the actual story where you actually feel sad when one of your main characters dies. 

PROS: (historical) story characters, improvements to diplomacy, siege battles are fun again, new trade and subterfuge mechanics, unique faction traits, runs smooth aside the occasional crash (hopefully this will get fixed), end turn time minimalised, mid to late game isn't the drag it used to be, romance and classic mode (thank you!).

2333,Strategic Gameplay,"Huge fan of the total war series and the old dynasty warriors games so this was a must buy for me. So far ive really enjoyed the game seems to be a solid advancement in the series. General dueling is cool, expanded gear systems for each general as well make it a bit more rpg like as well. So.. im going to tell you about the one negative experience ive had within this game, and the real reason of why im writing this review... so here goes.

               They added a new feature to the diplomacy system so that if you declare war shortly after breaking treaties or without breaking the treaties first, you receive a penalty towards your trustworthiness. (this does exist in other total war titles but is definitely more apparent when making decisions in this one) Your trustworthiness determines how willing factions are to working with you and making the yugest trade deals in history.. believe me. so it does make sense to me that if i tell you that i wont attack you, then declare on you the next turn, that i would seem to be untrustworthy to the rest of china..  So anyways, I had been land locked for quite a few turns and wanted to expand. So i proceeded to break off all of my agreements with a neighbor whose territory i wanted and waited out the 6 turns for the penalties to go away... Okay, great ive managed to avoid becoming untrustworthy by going through this process.. Armies were in place and ready to go, so i declared war, marched my army in and seized a city, Perfect! and no penalties in sight.. they had one temple left that i couldnt reach that turn, so I end my turn. My next turn arrives and i go back to my army and prepare to march up to take the temple which is when i noticed something odd.. When i click to attack the temple it asks if i want to declare war on the faction which is when i realize that out of no where... IM NO LONGER AT WAR WITH THEM........ So what happend??? Apparently the faction decided to become a vassal of another faction, which effectively nullifies any existing wars they have (it doesnt notify you of this either).. and the game proceeds to act as if this ""peace"" is something that you have agreed upon! The real kicker here is if you decide to go ahead and declare war AGAIN towards that very same faction you just declared on 1 turn before you will receive massive trustworthiness penalties... FOR WHAT?! how does this make any sense? simple answer is that it doesnt.. so discouraged and not able to claim the 1 remaining temple city of my neighbor that im now no longer at war with, i decide to just cut my losses and look for a new target to avoid becoming untrustworthy.. Find one, Break treaties, Wait 6 turns, Declare war. March toward my new enemies territory. End my turn....... THEY BECOME A VASSAL BEFORE MY NEXT TURN NULLIFYING MY WAR INSTANTLY BEFORE I COULD SEIZE A SINGLE TERRITORY... how is this a mechanic?!.. After it happening 2 times in a row and making a small dent in my forehead with a facepalm, i decided that i didnt care anymore. So I re-declared war on the very same faction that i just declared on 1 turn prior and took MASSIVE trustworthiness penalties.. i did manage to snag several of their cities and am now one of the most untrustworthy people in china at a -40 some trustworthiness. All that time wasted avoiding these penalties for the AI to abuse a feature. This has to be one of the worst thought out features of this game and the computer seems to do it quite a bit causing you to be land locked 99% of the time unless you dont care about diplomacy and being untrustworthy and just warmonger every faction around you.. good luck having allies, creating coalitions, creating your own vassals, or doing anything with the new shiny expanded diplomacy system because if they dont trust you.. they wont deal with you. I really do hope they address this aspect of the game because its really quite game breaking to follow all of their rules to engage in a war to have it end without your consent and be penalized for wanting to continue it.. All in all this is a great game and i would recommend getting it if youre a long time total war fan or like the three kingdoms era of china.",0.831499994,"['huge_fan', 'series', 'dynasty_warriors', 'advancement', 'series', 'gear', 'experience', 'reason', 'writing_review', 'feature', 'diplomacy', 'declare_war', 'treaty', 'treaty', 'penalty', 'trustworthiness', 'total_war_titles', 'decision', 'trustworthiness', 'faction', 'trade', 'deal', 'history', 'sense', 'rest', 'china', 'land', 'turn', 'expand', 'break', 'agreement', 'neighbor', 'territory', 'penalty', 'process', 'army', 'place', 'declared_war', 'army', 'city', 'penalty', 'sight', 'temple', 'reach', 'end_turn', 'turn', 'army', 'march', 'temple', 'attack', 'temple', 'declare_war', 'faction', 'war', 'happend', 'faction', 'vassal', 'faction', 'war', 'proceed', 'act', 'peace', 'kicker', 'declare_war', 'faction', 'one_turn', 'penalty', 'answer', 'claim', 'temple', 'city', 'neighbor', 'war', 'loss', 'target', 'avoid', 'break', 'treaty', 'declare_war', 'enemy', 'territory', 'end_turn', 'vassal', 'war', 'territory', 'mechanic', 'dent', 'forehead', 'facepalm', 'declared_war', 'faction', 'one_turn', 'penalty', 'city', 'people', 'penalty', 'abuse', 'thought', 'feature', 'land', 'diplomacy', 'warmonger', 'faction', 'luck', 'ally', 'coalition', 'vassal', 'expanded_diplomacy', 'hope', 'address', 'aspect', 'follow', 'rule', 'war', 'end', 'consent', 'wanting', 'long_time', 'fan', 'three_kingdoms_era_china']",120,"['peace', 'fan', 'happend', 'dynasty_warriors', 'penalty', 'address', 'three_kingdoms_era_china', 'war', 'follow', 'expand', 'attack', 'history', 'treaty', 'vassal', 'dent', 'answer', 'claim', 'total_war_titles', 'decision', 'coalition', 'one_turn', 'sense', 'act', 'facepalm', 'territory', 'mechanic', 'luck', 'land', 'agreement', 'hope', 'china', 'aspect', 'loss', 'end', 'avoid', 'place', 'city', 'temple', 'diplomacy', 'process', 'thought', 'turn', 'rest', 'faction', 'huge_fan', 'feature', 'neighbor', 'ally', 'people', 'trustworthiness', 'writing_review', 'expanded_diplomacy', 'kicker', 'series', 'end_turn', 'advancement', 'declare_war', 'rule', 'reason', 'trade', 'target', 'warmonger', 'sight', 'enemy', 'deal', 'declared_war', 'gear', 'army', 'forehead', 'long_time', 'consent', 'wanting', 'break', 'reach', 'experience', 'march', 'proceed', 'abuse']",78,"faction, army, diplomacy, vassal, war, player, people, way, city, problem",1

Battles are pretty similar to past historical Total War entries, with the exception of hero general units (available in Romance mode - generals aren't superhuman in the Records mode).

Most of the changes come from the overhauled diplomacy system (nice!) and general tweaks to the campaign. Diplomacy was very limited in past Total War games, so the ability to effectively barter with other factions adds a lot of possibilities to the state of your map.

My only complaint is that it's easy to get lost in the different building chains you can go down - there's a lot to keep track of for each location, because their income depends largely on what unique resources they have, if at all.

Other than that, fantastic game.

2249,Tactical Gameplay,"In short words this might be one of the best Total War games to date. It connects good battles with many deep campaign mechanics that TW:Warhammer games are lacking. I'm not fan of the setting and I was very sceptical about this title, but since I bought it, it grew on me.

There are two game modes, which differ a bit. Romance mod is the main with powerful, single entity heroes with abilities that can change the tide of battles. Records mode nerf heroes a bit, they come with plenty of cavalry bodyguards, more experienced your hero is, larger bodyguards he have. Also you can equip all your heroes with weapons, armors, mounts, ancilliaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilities.

Battle AI is probably the best in the entire series. Maybe not extremely intelligent, but AI does decent job trying to use their  missile units, flank with cavalry, protect archers with infantry. Rarely I see them doing something illogical or dumb. Battle AI is much more improved from Warhammer where it was very passive so you could easily use all your ammunition to kill it. Now it moves away from the walls inside the city when you have advantage in range units, when it notices that you have no ammo left AI comes back, trying to defend the gates, blocking any breakthroughs with units, making it difficult to get inside. Even if you break the first line, usually there is second line of troops trying to block the streets. 

If AI garrison has an army inside it is much more difficult to assault. Even when attacking from few directions, they spread more units to block other ways inside. My onli gripe was that town garrisons are pretty small, smaller than minor towns garrisons, so you need to build special bulding for more units, but I think its a small issue because mods for bigger garrisons or maybe official patch should make this right.

There is plenty of units, there are militia one available for every faction and general, there are few faction units, each faction have usually 2 of them, there are special units unlocked by tech tree (reforms) which are called Dragons. There are Dragons with axes, swords, cavalry, archers each call differently. Most interesting are Azure Dragons, glaive infantry with bows. They have special formation where two first lines form up against cavalry charge and rest is sitting behind and shooting from safe. It should be mentioned that each general can recruit to 6 units and you have 5 different types of generals, higher general rank better special units he can recruit. For example strategist on level 3 can recruit medium crossbowmen and on level 6 heavy crossbowmen and sentinel can recruit special medium sword infantry. You can have maximum three generals in one army. 

Campaign is much more interesting than in other TW games. Diplomacy for the first time works. Got that guy which you wanted to trade with, but he said ""no"" everytime? Not anymore. Now you know exactly why they want peace or agreements, game shows you how much points you need to make deal done. For example if there is -5.0 when you are proposing peace it means you need to soften the deal with some cash. If you crushed them in few battles the score might be +15, that means you can order them to give you additional money or even force them into being your vassal. There is also a great option with quick deal. You click it and choose ""trade agreement"" and you see all guys who may want to trade with you. It even says ""maybe"" or ""yes"" that means you need to offer those guys that are not convinced few things in return.

Moving on there is a food mechanic which affects you in many different ways. You need food to replenish troops and make your towns growing, but if you have food surplus you might sell it to other lords for money or agreements. If you have plenty of farms, but not many high income regions you can get a lot of gold just from food distribution. Population is coming back, bigger the town is, the more people it can sustain and it gives bonuses to income and replenishment. You need to upgrade your town to get more building slots and higher population cap.

Not everything is perfect and the worst part of the game is that there are many unique lords and generals, but there is only few dozen of them. When you play and recruit more they almost always look very simillar, with same bad weapons and armor, so in the lategame when some of your heroes die of old age the game is a bit less interesting, but it helps that when you reach King rank three Kingdoms are formed, leaders became Emperors and you need the other 2 of them to abdicate or conquer their emperor seat which is in their capital. Its pretty interesting mechanic because Emperors still can make peace and trade agreements but cant ally with each other. If you have a slower start it might happen that AI trigger the event and you wont even be one of the Emperors. Then you need to capture one of the seats for you to become a pretender.

There are few bugs and maybe few mechanics that dont work as intended, but nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make me stop playing. Satisfaction mechanic and relations between characters should be more impactful. Spy system is interesting and you can do amazing things with it, but your spies need a bit of luck to get hired by other factions to make it worthwhile.

Music is great in this game. There are many tracks i think and each of them different that I dont hear them repeat too often even when playing long sessions for many hours. Music in battle is more tense and during campaign its more calm, pleasant for ears. There are also cool options to choose from, like changing colour palettes you can use Romance palette while playing in Records mode, etc. There are unit cards and alternative unit cards, english or chinese voiceovers with english subtitles. Not everyone might like it, but characters do a bit trashtalking during battles, some lines are a bit cringe, but I mostly like them.

TLDR: As long TW fan (my first game was Medieval 1) I can really recommend this game. It isn't flawless, but it is probably the best release of CA game in the studio history. Battles are good, campaign is great and character focus is making this game a bit more interesting. Few small patches and mods should make this a masterpiece.

1031,Tactical Gameplay,"Three Kingdoms is an excellent addition to the total war franchise with more in-depth diplomacy and character interactions., as well as a diverse cast of warlords/factions which all have a distinct feel to them (most even come with a special in-game currency that further improves diplomacy). For instance, the master strategist Cao Cao can start proxy wars and manipulate relations between factions to his advantage (much like the real-life schemer) whilst the Tyrant Dong Zhuo lets the player intimidate other factions into accepting diplomatic deals. He can even use this to bully other factions into giving him money or land for free!

The music is simply incredible, and like Shogun 2 it blends in with a distinct art style and optional Chinese audio to immerse the player in 3rd century China. 

Characters are still bonkers and some (like L?? B??) is worth 1000 normal soldiers if micromanaged properly! Players from the Warhammer Total Wars will right at home here. But if that isn't your cup of tea you can always switch over to ""Records mode"" where generals are accompanied by a bodyguard and function very much like the classical TW games. Fatigue is also increased to make battles feel less arcade-y and more tactical. 

Recruitment has been revamped, where different classes of characters can recruit different types of units. Which means that you are no longer bogged down by spamming barracks that inevitably become inefficient as your borders expand away from them, which really makes the game feel more fast paced and dynamic! (Though I imagine this might not sit well with everyone)

All in all, it is an incredibly atmospheric, immersive and fun experience which anyone interested in strategy games will find thoroughly enjoyable!

It is rare for a big developer to go back to being awesome after disappointing the fans many times. Things like this give hope for Bethesda, EA and Ubisoft. I am very glad that his game sold well over a million copies in the first week, as it shows that releasing a (mainly) single player game adhering to the highest standards is greatly rewarded.

As for the game: Gotta go back to playing so no time to write a long review, if you are a TW buff then this game is a must, if you are not then I can honestly say this is by far the best RTS/TBS game released on Steam in the past few years so what are you waiting for?

I'm mediocre at best with other Total War titles, Do I stand a chance against Lu Bu? 5. If I make attempt to purchase, do all the proceeds go to the Chinese? 6. How awesome possum is the campaign map? 7. Is 60 dollars worth the purchase?

2. 1st generation SKYNET AI proto-type operation phase BETA.

5. Absolutely not, Creative Assembly would go to war with China. CA has female special forces TACOM units. They wouldn't know what hit them.

2749,Content & Authenticity,"          Tl';dr: if you like historic TW titles and you hesitate to buy this game, I'm telling you - this is one of the best, maybe the best TW ever and yes, it's fully playable and enjoyable since day 1. 
          For the record I skipped both Warhammer titles. I also skipped thrones of Brithania when i read about ridiculous changes implemeted to game. 
           I'm not sure what to begin with. I'll go with expectations - during first hours of gameplay I can say ALL my expectations were fullfilled and lots more. This game contains the best features from every TW title. First of all the game is ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Im not talking about graphics only - I'm talking about interface, music characters, charts. I think it's more beautiful than Shogun 2 which I absolutely loved. Then we have the gameplay. SI can be very smart and deceptive (I had serious concerns when watching eary gameplays on YT). 
          Something i always missed in previous total wars: storytelling, or story-like features. I remember adding mods to Shogun 2 so generals can get more points in order to make them more individual and interesting. In this game generals are not only summary of their stats, they are characters and they have big impact on your gaming style and they make great background for the story. Don't get me wrong - it's not general centered, its just that they added many factors into battlefield and campagin map. When you start campaign you can choose generals to be half-god single characters on battlefield or classic with guard (I went with the second option).  You can really feel you are running dynasty and you can somehow start getting attached to the characters. They are very well written, many of them are very characteristic, for example Liu Bei is ""virtous idealist"" while there are others described as ""drunken fighter"", ""warriors"" , ""scholars"", ""bandits"" and so on and on - it determines their skills, abilities and traits.  Game adds many very interesting events and missions and they are more creative than ""defeat army X"" or ""survive until following date"". There are other faction leaders that will give you various propositions so you really feel like you participate in global politics (not only war/peace/trade cases). Did I mention new, complex diplomacy system that is very interesting and it's very natural?
          Economy is also very well thought as well as technology tree - every mechanism  implemented in game could be historically justified. It gan get as complex as Attila but it's not that exhausting - you don't feel like you have to fight for every point of satisfaction, yet economy can become very ""grateful"" if handeled wisely.  Moreover, despite adding many factors to the game (prestige, supplies, complex diplomacy, intrigues, kind of story telling) nothing seems to be added just for the sake of it. 
             Two weeks ago when I was trying to figure out Uesugi in Shogun 2 for a third time I was thinking that this game had this exceptional balance in every aspect and I thought of shogun 2 as a best and most complete TW part ever (I also play Attila a lot but I prefer small - scale feeling). Guys I swear I've never been so excited for game that wanted to write review. I want to say big THANK YOU to Creative Assembly for one of the greatest gaming experiences in my life and I must say I never thought I'd get that excited about any game ever. 11/10 I'm probably gonna play this game for years and years.

The good:
-runs and looks better then warhammer 2 for me. got a rtx 2080 ti with a i7 8700k and can run everything ultra with extreme unit size on 1440p with ease.
- on the campaign map the computer is a actually challenge where in warhammer you could snowball pretty easy mid to late game here 100 turns in and you can still find yourself in a spot where you can get overwhelmed.
-diplomacy is finally fleshed out and it added allot of stuff that i wanted from warhammer. 

The cons:
-i said it runs great, but i have had multiple crashes already where the screen would freeze for 5 seconds shut it self off. hopefully they will fix that soon.
-it seems they really focused on the campaign map, cause the battles are abit meh compared to warhammer and the generals/heroes talents are pretty boring overal.

-Graphic: Very nice, the campaign map is beautiful. Too bad that aside from legendary heroes, there is so few unique portraits for other characters ( Hoping for future DLCs). If you like grittier visual, then select record option in the graphic menu.

-Sound: There is chinese dub in the game and they sound great, the music is nice too.

-Gameplay: Messing around the game a bit and there are a few things to note:
+ Pros: Much better diplomacy , many new systems like espionage or relationships make the game more interesting and complex. The abilities to choose Romance or Record mode ( more realistic) is a nice touch.

+Cons: New UI looks nice but needs time to get used to, the UI for settlement development seem cluttered ( I prefer the Rome, warhammer style)

+Mixed: AI campaign is good but sometime they really stupid ( Yuan Shao keep falling for my ambushes every single time LOL) Can't say much about battle AI either.

Overall, the game left a very good impression to me. And I'm excited for future improvement of the game.

3125,Content & Authenticity,"   So far after about 22 hours I have to say this is my favourite Total War game to date,

  It has done such a good job with the campaign side of the game this time round, From the relationships within your faction to the Underground Spy network and everything in between just seems to flow smoothly. It can be a bit overwhelming at first even for non new to the series players but they have added a lot to the game in terms of help. F1 will bring up an in depth over view of your UI and allow you to cursor over any part and it gives a very in depth explanation to each one. 

  The siege battles are also done really well, though can take a bit longer than other release in the series if you plan on having Ultra or Extreme Unit Sizes. For the Rome 2 fans I may be mistaken but there is no first person mode for the Siege Defensive's but there are more than just the Guard Towers, The addition of  the Trebuchet  to the defensive side of things which was not in WH2 or TOB is great. The fire arrows while on the other side of the wall also add a really nice effect when they start to burn down half the buildings if fires catch.

  Performance wise - I run on a I7-8700 and GTX 1060, on 1080p I get 60 fps constantly after using Rock, Paper Shotguns article to adjust some of the Advanced Settings. If you plan on running the benchmark while adjust make sure you click accept/confirm prior to testing it or it will revert to the previous settings you had saved last.

  I would give a number out of 10 but I don't generally review games, I guess the hype train which was TotalWarOfficial (Wheels & Tom) on Twitch really got me excited for the game and with the company being one of the first I have seen to push a game and really listen the feedback from the testing stages (Closed Alpha Etc.) to implement changes for the better as opposed to meeting a set date due to Estimated Quotas is a refreshing site in the gaming world.

  I would highly recommend this game not only to returning fans of the series but also others who are thinking of getting into Total War, You won't regret it.

3355,Tactical Gameplay,"It's really really good. Straight off the bat you'll notice how polished everything is. They've clearly put in a lot of work to make this release as smooth as possible. No Rome II re-enactment this year!

This review will focus mostly on what makes 3K good and different from previous Total War games. The basic gist of the game is the same. Build your armies. Recruit your generals. Paint the map your colour.

The game runs smooth. No lag whatsoever both on the map and in battles, which is a first for me when it comes to Total War games. Warhammer runs well, but it can chug a bit in very large battles.
Even battles with 4 full stack armies going at it during a city siege battle doesn't lag in 3K. This is probably because the game further refines the Warhammer combat system in that there are very few ""finishing"" moves (or matched combat as I believe the technical term is).
In Warhammer this could on occasion look a bit boring as units would just swipe somewhere in the enemy's general direction. In 3K every unit is either infantry or cavalry, so they've done a much better job in actually making it look like they're hitting each other.  Troops can also climb walls much like in Shogun 2 (they use grappling hooks) so the AI has an easier time of it too.

They could've settled for a Shogun 2 in China, but instead it has a ton of unique features that sets it apart from the older games:

- Character relationships (more than just A is married to B, generals actually remember specific acts which alters how they feel about one another. Even generals that fight each 
other can become friends.

- Every character has his own equipment and skill tree, much like in Warhammer but more to the point.

- Building trees have far more depth to them than both Shogun and Warhammer. It's more than just building farms and barracks all over the place. Population plays a large factor. If a city is maxed out, public order drops. If you upgrade the city to make room, you 
 may run out of food which drops public order. If you build tax buildings you'll lose more public order. Rebellions are guaranteed if you're not careful.

- Romance mode is a unique feature on its own. It adds a lot of fantasy elements to it such as famous generals having very powerful abilities that can turn the tide.

- Historical events take place *during* the campaign. Without spoiling any of them, you can choose to break away from history (or the novel) when these events are presented to you. Some of them can lead to negative consequences.

- Diplomacy works. The AI doesn't act like an asinine idiot in this game. They actually have good reason to ask you for things and will offer alliances when it's beneficial to them. Diplomacy is also affected by personal relationships and behaviour. If they're poor, they'll value gold. If they're starving, they'll value food. If they're powerful, they'll try to vassalize you. If you're powerful, they'll try to appease you.

- Campaigns are tailor made for the faction you're playing. They all have unique missions and events.

- The Emperor plays a large role and basically affords you a free ally if you manage to secure him. 

- Unique and powerful units require a similarly powerful general to lead them. Armies are loyal to their commander, not their faction. Every 6 units are led by a general. Units cannot be swapped between generals.

As an aside: the default graphics settings make the game look blurry. Change the Anti-aliasing and turn off Depth of Field for much crisper visuals. It's a good looking game. They did go for a more colourful look rather than bleak realism.

3249,Content & Authenticity,"When I saw the first few videos and gameplay snippets I was worried, however CA actually did they best thing they could have done in the lead up to the original release date a few months ago, they delayed 3K.

Honestly that has been the best thing that could've happened, CA have listened to the community, actually released a fully optimised game and included features fans have been begging for to either be added or included from previous titles. Just for perspective I have a mid-tier gaming laptop and can run this on high graphics settings with max unit sizes with no lag and a stable 50 fps. 

I've also got to say, huge props to Wheels and Tom from the community team at CA for running the streams in the lead up to launch. They've kept me entertained and wanting to play this for ages. 

The game itself is the best in the series of total war games so far, and I was a big fan of the warhammer games as well. 

Worth buying at full price on release, and I expect more interesting things to come from this title with the promise of additional chapters from the romance novel and alternate settings. (Personally I'm hoping for the Qin unification wars, being a big fan of the 'Kingdom' anime).

I am torn to not recommend the game just because out of spite, but thankfully my sane(r) half prevailed. 

The game is simply gorgeous, there is no way around it. The music, the graphics, the design everything is completely flawless. And for the first time all the parts of this game fit together perfectly. 

There are minor bugs present every now and then in the single player mode and the Ki behaves stupidly agressive at times (even sallied out of their encirclement once - that's new) but that is to be expected.
