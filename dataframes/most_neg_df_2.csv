3,1811,Tactical Gameplay,"liked it in the beginning , but as continued , it only became harder on me as the small things thought would get used to slowly grind my gears to halt and not want to touch it anymore. while it seems more stable than most other games at launch , still run into the crash to desktop problems. but putting that aside , find it incredibly difficult to play the game as the ai just hates you , and for some reason , only you. this problem compounds when you try and use some factions special mechanic , many of which require being able to actually deal in diplomacy with other factions. you ca not be making deals with people , when all they want is war with you. and ca not prove that they do this consistently , but find , even when they ’re at conflict with others , they will dedicate themselves to screwing you over. i ’ve had faction declare war on me , half the country away , sail all their troops down just to ruin my day , and at the same time , someone else declared war on them , and they did not even bat an eye , even let that faction take over all their original land and their capitol.","['thing', 'gear', 'touch', 'game', 'run', 'crash', 'desktop', 'problem', 'play', 'reason', 'problem', 'compound', 'faction', 'mechanic', 'diplomacy', 'faction', 'deal', 'people', 'war', 'conflict', 'dedicate', 'faction', 'declare_war', 'country', 'troop', 'day', 'time', 'declared_war', 'bat', 'eye', 'faction', 'land', 'capitol']",-0.9881,-0.7586094264622374
4,1821,Tactical Gameplay,"this is certainly the most stable on release from the series. have yet to have one crash ... .well that is the positive. some of the mechanics need to be changed especially those that effect the mid game point. the game cheats you in the sense that you can see the ai factions in negative cash and also food resource yet they throw stacks after stack at you whilst suffering no attrition ... this should not be thing. the worst tactic that the ai seems to employ is sending stack into your territory you then have to send an army after it. due to the ' retreat once ' bs before they have to fight you , they constantly just retreat out of your reach so you can never initiate battle. so one of your limited armies are spent chasing some minor stack of cowards around the map ... get it sorted. diplomacy is lot more in depth albeit completely broken , as factions will randomly attack you for no reason then want to trade the next minute. basically this is re skin of warhammer with new things that do not work properly and broken ai ... give this game dog turds out of 10.","['release', 'series', 'crash', 'mechanic', 'effect', 'point', 'cheat', 'faction', 'cash', 'food', 'resource', 'stack', 'stack', 'attrition', 'thing', 'tactic', 'employ', 'stack', 'territory', 'army', 'retreat', 'initiate', 'battle', 'army', 'stack', 'coward', 'diplomacy', 'depth', 'faction', 'attack', 'reason', 'trade', 'minute', 'skin', 'thing', 'dog']",-0.9607,-0.7375731970471323
