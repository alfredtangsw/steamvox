-----
When you start the campaign, they introduce just enough of the surrounding world to not overwhelm you. 

Gameplay feels very smooth on both the overworld level and in large scale battles. 

Everything looks amazing, especially the tech tree. 

The dynamics between your generals and leaders is charming, and it encourages you to really invest in the characters and keep them alive. That also makes their deaths even more impactful.

I love the duel system. Even though there isn't a ton of depth or control over it, something about watching the armies clear the way and watch two generals battle to the death is lots of fun.

This is nothing that can or should be changed, but at first it was very hard for me to keep track of the names all of the factions surrounding me. Many are very similar, and I had to constantly check pictures and the map to make sure I was talking to the right person.

I don't know whether it's because you either need to be 1. a fan of the era itself or 2. i've been too spoilt with Warhammer but as a long term Total War fan (played all since Rome), Warhammer brought an element of fantasy to the game that this version sucked dry for me...

The user interface is the worst part, it's a massively confusing mess; lots of information crammed into a too-small space and denoted by confusing and unclear icons. On top of that, information is often banished to different corners of the screen, never before in a TW game have I had to spend so much time looking around to find the most basic information. Even something as fundamental as giving a right click drag order to a unit (ie. specifying the formation you want it to take at its destination) has been screwed up, the clear little markers for each soldier are gone, replaced with a thoroughly uninformative grey box.

Then there's the balance, which is to this day an utter mess. There's enough broken that I can't be bothered to list it all, suffice to say it's the least balanced TW game there has ever been. Worse than the early magic in TWW1, worse than the broken cavalry in Attila.

Also the recruitment system. I like the idea of restricting units to particular general types' retinue... but the implementation is awful. Some general types are infinitely more desirable than others, because they get a range of great units, while others are entirely worthless because their specialised unit types bring absolutely nothing you need. Example: The strategist is the ranged specialist, and is the only general able to recruit trebuchets or decent archers/crossbows, making them basically essential to every army. On the other hand commanders specialise in melee cavalry, which is utterly worthless. The whole system feels restrictive more than it does interesting, making it very hard to like the game at all.

On top of all this, series-long issues persist, like the psychopathic diplomacy AI, psychic AI hovering its armies just outside your reach, braindead battle AI. Or perhaps it's a small improvement, but by this point the game has put me in a bit of a negative mindset towards it, so I can hardly be called impartial.

The whole game seems to be a victim of CA trying to be clever, trying to reinvent the wheel, and failing to do so. I hope this isn't indicative of the series' future, because so far I've found Three Kingdoms far inferior to even Thrones of Britannia.

Only con I have is I loved the Shogun II style of battle more, where arrows would stay on the ground and enemies would be dying slowly pincushioned with them.  

The generals and duels are great, and the managing of the cities is something I am enjoying rather than feeling like a chore. I like the changes to spy except for there is no button to recall them, have to get them into various positions to get options to bring them back so careful who you use.

I highly recommend buying this if you loved ROTK. I feel it is in the top 3 of total war games with Shogun II and Medieval II and is definitely my fav ROTK. 

It is probably going to get a lot of DLC content as well from the looks of it, which is both good and bad depending on how you look at it. New content is great. Content people feel should have been in base game and probably was already developed not so much. 

The first dlc's (Blood Pack & Turban)  really felt like they should have just been part of the game and does worry me that they are going to follow paradoxes strategy (of piecing out games and selling them off later as dlc) until next thing you know you easily paid 100-150 for the title. Like wanting a pizza but having to buy it by the slice so you pay 30$ for a 10$ pie. I understand making the blood pack a dlc for the sake of the rating, but could still skirt that rule and just offer it as a free dlc.

The diplomacy is vastly expanded, with new options such as cooperative alliances, ultimatums, etc. The new retinue system is okay, as it will take time to get used to. Generals are no longer numbers and letters on a chart, they are actual people who need to be appeased. 

Battles are okay, the only downside being the lack of variety of units for different factions, which each faction getting 2 or 3 units that are usually upgrades of existing units. General duels are an interesting thing, but the AI usually refuses to duel your generals.

I really dislike the UI, and I belive the romance mode (especially the duels) a big bullshit inserted somehow to draw MOBA players in. Or maybe it is just the chinese setting I strongly dislike.

The whole time I was playing it I just wanted to go and play Romance of the Three Kingdoms 11, 10, 8 or 9 again... It was great seeing someone else try a Three Kingdoms game... But I now understand why no one has bothered besides Koei. Because they figured out how to do Three Kingdoms a long time ago, and for me, this outing was kind of a dud.

I believe mods can salvage this game, I hope they can. But the base game is just massively underwhelming. Not to mention that unmodded Total War battles haven't felt good since Shogun, and even then they needed a lot of fixing. It's like they kept tweaking and tweaking the battles in total war games to the point where they broke them, and aren't sure how to fix them.

The battles here remind me when Rome 2 released, not as bad, but not much better. Which I guess is the new normal for the series, hence why so many newer total war players don't notice the issues with battles. They just don't feel good. None of the units have any weight or impact to them like they used to. So battles feel like pouring two cans of spagetti-o's down a slope and watching them meet in the middle.

Everyone dies too fast giving you no time to really strategize or maneuver. It's just blob vs blob with a couple cooldown abilities, oh but you have hero units now. Which are neat, but they don't make up for the other issues. There are just so many niggling flaws in the core design of this game that it's going to need an overhaul mod.

It's not a bad Total War game. It's playable (which is crazy that needs to even be said) but I don't really recommend it at full price. If you like the setting, wait for mods, and probably a sale too.

I havent seen a Total War game this good since Shogun 2, in terms of presentation its very optimized, feels fresh and the art style is just amazing and conveys the events of the story well.

In terms of gameplay campaign map is better than ever, and is so much more complex and might scare off new players to the series, though C.A. thought this one out and made an INFO BUTTON to explain every overlay and micromanagement of the game, also you have easy access within game to videos and other media to help explain the game.
Some factions need some patching ASAP like Yuan Shao because he literally vassals anyone in any area of the map and if you dont kill him fast he and his buddy's will be a MAJOR THREAT TO YOU AND YOUR EXPANSION.
So kill him fast or make way to become his best friend and destroy him from inside.
Diplomacy is the best there is yet, though trade agreements are hard to grasp.
Spies are amazing and more fleshed out than ever, and you can win over entire faction with them (wont spoil more).

In battles the game is divided by hero classes and correspondant retinues (this last is nothing new from past TW games).
Can play in 2 modes Romance or Records, being Romance mode the one that shines in this one because heroes become unique in their own way.
Some hero classes need some balancing.
the rest is just almost the same and previous titles.

Overall the game is amazingly fun i know this is not the best review but just my thoughts on it, hoping to get more factions in DLC later. (Yellow Turbans DLC is amazing BTW) and (Blood and Gore adds new animations and pesonality to the game but IT SHOULD BE FREE).

Although the game is good and very enjoyable, at the moment need some big patche to fix some things, nothing game breaking though but frustrating.

- Can switch all audio to its native language so you can RP as a China man
- Music is pretty good too using classic Chinese instruments

Gameplay-wise
- There's two modes. Romance and Records. Records is your classic Total War mode. Only notable thing in Romance is that heroes (or your generals) are alone and don't have any bodyguards in their unit and they can initiate duel with enemy generals while the rest of the world ignores them. Also for some reason, AI is smarter when playing Records.
So it's kind of like Warhammer Total War's heroes except with the 1 on 1 mechanic.
- Not much unit variety unfortunately just like Shogun 2's but this makes it kind of balanced.
- Diplomacy kind of works. You can still get around it by juggling with the numbers. 
- Everyone will hate you except these factions with one or two specific traits
- Always bring two artillery with you to kill half the enemy army
- The army stacks are actually an improvement. Each general has its own classes and can recruit a specific type of unit based on their class so you don't need to worry that much about the enemy building like 1 million war elephants or equivalent here. Also, they have a rock/papers/scissors stat for the said general classes which something like good vs infantry, good vs other generals, etc

As someone who has played every single instalment in the Total War series, this has probably been the poorest release to date. Sure, it is fairly well polished in the past and does not have the technical faults that other releases have suffered from, but the game very quickly becomes boring.

Diplomacy: Very much improved. However it's near impossible to properly identify who's foe and who's friend in the Diplomacy screen. You can 'group' alliances but then the screen resets each time and it's all a bit of a mess. Also, when you are in Diplomacy mode you have a good range of options to help balance out deals. From trading cities to giving your daughters hand - it all comes together well.

Campaign Gameplay: As soon as I took over my neighbouring settlements I had no-one to fight as I had built strong relationships and had to send my armies into the abyss. Too many generals to select make the game a bit too easy to just quickly build up armies and reply to threats. At the start of every turn I am getting about 10 random messages saying this general has become friends with someone else...it's completely overpowered and confusing. There are too many generals in my retinue to know who they are and the relationship element was not well planned.

Battle Gameplay: A severe lack of unit diversity quickly means that the battles become monotonous and you find yourself using the same tactics for every single fight.

Graphics: I am playing this on 4K with an RTX 2080 and the graphics are absolutely garbage. The units are all blurry and it just does not look anything like I expected. I have turned off ray tracing and still the problem persists. CA seem to know of the problem and are working to fix the problem.

Sieges - I spend 8 turns building tunneling equipment only for it not to appear once the battle commenced.

Things I do like:

Diplomacy updates - this is excellent
Tech Tree
Improved Building Options and the range of different buildings available
Option to have hero units or Bodyguard types as in Medieval

I'm a westerner with very little knowledge of Asian/Chinese history and culture so when it comes to Asian names, flags, etc I don't really have a point of reference.. so when I'm a close ally of Liu Shang and a mortal enemy of Liu Zhang, I'm already pretty lost.
If you then mix in the fact that most factions flags are identical (the symbol that changes is usually obscured by the faction leaders portrait), right now in my game I have about 7 factions with red and white striped flags, one green, one purple, one yellow and one black all with white stripes, but they are all so darkly coloured that I have to concentrate to even notice the colour difference between them.
Then there are the ones with triangle flags, a few of them do stand out, there's a red one (han empire), a green one and a blue one, the rest are variations of brown. 

At a glance of the strategic map (world map), there are units all over, some of them have got to be mine, but I have no quick way of knowing which ones (it's some of the ones with redish brown flags, but far from all of them ..) , the fastest way is to simply open the list and then choose them from there.
Also, when a unit is selected it doesn't become highlighted, so with two units next to each other, there's no easy way to know which one you've selected.
When you want units to support each other in combat there's seemingly also no indicator of how close they have to be for that (and the distance does seem to vary, whether due to terrain or what I know not ... )

Hopefully there will be mods to fix some of these issues, but as it stands it's probably, sadly my least favourite in the total war series :/",1563121621,1563121621,False,0.5,True,False,False,368,en

There are quiet a few things that i would like to be tweaked to make this game truly shine, but still this one is my personal favorite after Shogun 2 and that's why:
1) This game does have some style unlike Rome 2 or Attila that i consider a disaster. It looks beautiful with vibrant colour palette (you can enable poop-brown mess in the menu if you prefere it for some reason) and comes with decent soundtrack.
2) AI on campaign map isnt the brightest, but most of the time their actions make sense since they tend to follow some sort of pre-defined behaviour patterns. The problems are obvious only late game, which is still a great achievement for the studio. Changes made have allowed players to forge reliable alliances that can actually last trough entire game, and heavy cases of faction rivalry could never be forgotten.
3) Every faction in Three Kingdoms does have unique mechanics and units to inspire certain playstyle, probably more than any other Total War game (maybe with exception of Warhammer that i never played)
Some complains:
1) The battle AI is still pretty much brain dead, they only have a chance of winning when packing overpowered characters (i am sure this can be neglected in ""records"" game mode) and having great number advantage.
2) The balance is shifted heavily towards ranged units, especially high tier archers and trebuchets - they always kill hundreds with no casualties, while melee infantry can barely kill 40-50 and usually left with 1\3 of their capacity. With ranged units being this strong - siege battles are a joke. There is a viable tactic - engage with melee units while your archers destroy everything from one side and cavalry charges from the other. Also there are heroes.. The game was designed around ""romance"" mode, heroes are overpowered single units with special abilities rather than a stronger-than-usual squad that gives some bonuses. I might try the ""records"" mode later just to see if there is a big difference.
3) The multiplayer campaign is not designed for co-op in mind, you should know that after 1 player becomes an emperor the game picks 2 AI factions for other emperor positions, simply ignoring your existance. Maybe it's more fun to play being rivals until one of the players destroyed.
4) I still very much miss the old multiplayer battles from Shogun 2, with character progression, ranked matchmaking and all that great stuff.

Teases with tiny teeny annoyances and when you look at the big picture it all together ruins the fun. A shame - because at the core it is well done, good production quality, new interesting features and an unspent setting to explore.

1) The scenario: Worst and most unbalanced map I've ever seen. All factions hump each other. But one - it gets to gobble up all the southern map completely unopposed while the rest battles each other.

2) Cheating: Noone expects Skynet AI, but on normal difficulty I expect reasonable AI buffs and reasonable lemming AI. Not here, the AI cheats like it's Emperor level. Anyone explained CA what difficulty levels are good for?

3) Bloody features like locking tech tree behind buildings you mostly only need to unlock tech tree branches. Advisor, Jesus Christ, I wanted to strangle it. The popup spam was totally over the top. Disable it right away - first thing to do in the options.

4) Court: Everone and their dogs desires higher court position. Even if there is just 2 positions. Then they get unhappy with each other because that army incurred losses - well what do you expect when the AI factions go all lemming on the player? Make sure to pile random event on top so that everyone is on the brink of defection.

5) Income: Bloody impossible. Units are so expensive you'll struggle to build up decent economy unless you start with some faction on some border (which are few btw, because it's apparently fun to spawn players in lemming moshpits).

6) Bugs: Luckily I didnt encounter any gamebreaking stuff, but when you see AI armies attack from march that just adds that tiny bit annoyance to the overall picture. Or when you find out that Liu Bei somehow collected regions during the first 20 turns that are totally eleswhere from his starting location.

7) Scripted events: These are at times completely ridiculous, given you have to face AI factions that field full 2 stacks at round 5.

8) Online help / tooltips: They suck and are insufficient to explain core basic gameplay mechanics. Online encyclopedia often doesn't even load the page.

9) Let's count this too, because it's bloody annoying as well: The crappy launcher that takes forever to load stuff noone wants to see, because we bloody just want to play the game. Not look at bloody DLC advertisment. Believe me: Make a good game and I'll gladly check your DLCs. I had no problem buying the Tomb Kings (my fav faction) and the Vampire Coast (super fun) with TW Warhammer 2.

10) This I expected: Low variety in units. Upkeep is just too expensive to look at anything else but bloody militia. And then the better versions often dont really cut it for their price and cost.

I browsed the workshop and found a couple mods that address some issues, but right now I just can't bring myself to try another playthrough just to find out that I'm ragequitting over some bullcrap after turn 45. It's just a waste of time. 
If you're looking for fun: Consider TW Warhammer 2, they gimped it to barely minimum faction variety, but the amount of diverse and interesting gameplay you get out of these far, FAR, outstrips 3 Kingdoms.

But I realized when talking about the Total War franchise to my co-worker, I just can't recommend this game.  Not over past titles anyway.  If this was the only Total War game ever made, then yeah it's worth trying, but it's not the cornerstone of a PC Gamer's library like older titles were. 

I will start off with saying I'm a bit biased with the theme.  The Chinese culture just isn't pulling me in like Rome or Medieval did.  It's wonderfully well done, however, so this is a bias I’m trying to overlook while giving a review, but undeniably may be negatively impacting my overall fondness of the game. 

Things I liked:
— Building up Provinces (Or “commanderies”), are not as cookie cutter. You can’t choose what to build in minor settlements, so you have to decide if you want to “snowball” those benefits with what you build in the main city, or “force” something else. 
— — This gives a lot of replayability, but also can make the game brutal for new or returning Total War players. 
-- -- It also blends well with the enhanced diplomacy. Made too much food and not enough money?  Trade it for cash with someone. 

— Diplomacy is easier to jump into, with much more impact than in previous games. It adds a deep layer of strategy to the game. 

— The focus on characters gives the game a “Crusader Kings 2” feel, which really pulled me in... at first. 

— The army Retinue system (units tied to characters) is a much more streamlined approach. Units don’t “die” like they did in previous games, and you don’t need to ferry units all over the map because they had to be made in particular cities (also makes building construction strategy easier in that regard).  It was a bit of a slap in the face though when I learned that top end ""Dragon"" units can be made under any character, but mid-level units you unlock have to match the color of the character.  It's not well described in the tech tree. 

— Reforms (tech tree) is neat how it’s purely turn based. No research bonuses. Makes for a consistent game and adds to replayability. 
— — However, the UI is terrible, confusing, and downright off-putting. 



Things I did not like:
— Romance mode.  You can pick either Romance mode, or Records mode, with Records being more traditional to Total War.  I was led to believe Records was for the ""hardcore traditionalist that values tactics and troop management"".  I didn't feel like I fit that bill at all, so I tried Romance mode first.  Not. A. Fan.  I'd argue it actually makes the battles harder.  Your first goal is now to manage your generals vs. their generals, and sort out the cannon fodder minion troops later.  
     I learned after looking up guides that most players (at least veteran players of it) prefer Records mode, and not because of the ""difficulty"" of it.  So I tried Records... much much better.  

-- Characters.  The character development seemed interesting, especially since I am a huge fan of Crusader Kings 2. But it just falls flat.  It's lack of enjoyment doesn't balance out the tedium of the management.  Getting a general high level just to have him leave because now he's outgrown you is annoying.  Manageable to prevent that, sure, but it's just an extra layer I have to worry about now, without any payoff of ""fun"". 

-- The cartooniness of it. This is probably what's leading most to my overall dissatisfaction. The fighting in battles just doesn't have any meat to it.  It's like watching Warcraft III troops fight. Probably worse.  Troop A swings at air. Troop B flies back in comical fashion.  Rome 2 was way more satisfying for interpersonal combat.  You could almost *feel* the brutalness of a veteran experienced army. 
     Even the archers fall short.  Video after video tells you how powerful archers are in this game.  And they aren't wrong.  But it's like watching a laser light show, with enemies falling over at random.  And not even satisfactorily. In Rome 2 the arrows are getting buried in shields, pinging the ground and having troops stumble to the ground.  In 3K, they just kind of magically fall over when they decide to. 
     In truth, I bet the mechanics are fairly similar, but maybe it's the graphics or art on top of it that make it feel less meaty.  

In the end it's still a good enough game, but I wouldn't recommend it over other titles in the series.",1562960335,1562960335,False,0.524978816509246826,True,False,False,791,en

Then after FINALLY winning that war....which took WAY longer than it would have in any other TW to just grab 2 fracking cities I start realizing just what a small fish in a big sea I am  and Liu Bei is, Well, not going to be anybody I'm going to be winning against.

I have, sadly, 1000s of hours worth of playtime with and without mods from the big titles, so I probably have a good understanding of the games in general. 

Unfortunately, when it comes to TK, I just find the whole thing... lacking. I read all these reviews about the level of depth the campaign goes into, particularly in diplomacy and while, yes there is more 'options', I would not say there is any more depth. The whole mechanic now feels clunky and unnecessarily complicated. Diplomacy did need an overhaul but I just dont think they hit the mark with TK and more work needs to be done. It just isnt any more 'fun' but a whole lot more work.

In terms of the campaign artwork- again, not a fan. I never had a big interest in the TK era but I would like to think I can at least put aside that lack of interest and review the game for its own worth. It is pretty for a TW game, but it doesnt feel like an incredible leap forward from WHII - perhaps ive just become too corrupted by fantasy of that game to come back to a gameworld where theres just not a lot of interesting stuff going on. It doesnt [i]feel[/i] like the game is in the midsts of a civil war... it feels dull.

As for combat, the AI has not improved, despite the some of the reviews on here. It still promotes turtling and the old shield wall/archer combo with the oh so expected cav charge on your flank. Just expected more variety on this point.

The battles themselves are also a step back from WH and the melee is not cinematic nor epic. Instead its a clumsy stabby-stabby-fest of fluttering banners. They really went over the top with the banners on this one. Its actually often difficult to make out which troops are yours, but you would really care either way as you feel absolutely zero affiliation to them as they all look very clone-like, similar to how the troops in Rome II or Attila felt. Actually, I would prefer to play either of those games over this title as both had something to endear themselves to you about. This one doesnt.

The hero/ Romantic option is pretty much the only way to go as its the only thing that adds a lick of variety to some very dull affair. 

Unless you are a huge Chinese history fanbois this title is not worth the full price. If you are a TW collector such as myself, amuse yourself with WH and its oodles of replayability rather than jumping onto this. Wait for its inevitable 50% sale price.

As a long time fan of the Total War series, I have to say this is the most polished TW game I've ever played.  I haven't noticed any bugs so far, the user interface is absolutely beautiful and fits the historical setting of Three Kingdoms, and the battles are of course great fun.  The diplomacy system is a massive improvement over Thrones of Britannia (which wasn't exactly a complete game but I rest my case) and the campaign map itself is very nice to look at.  The graphics are a sight for sore eyes, not to mention the fact that CA managed to optimize the game much better than Thrones of Britannia so it actually runs well.  I'm really enjoying the Romance mode, which essentially turns generals on both sides of the battlefield into overpowered killing machines.  I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the Total War series and generally to anyone who enjoys RTS and turn-based strategy games.",1562769264,1562769612,True,0,True,False,False,161,en

I'm new to the Total War Series, but I always loved political strategic real-time battle games like Age of Empires, but this works with a turn by turn system, which gives you the freedom to take your time when its you. Unlike Age of Empires where it's race for Feudal Age and kill the enemy. 

In this game you choose a faction leader to lead your people and start your empire from there. The tutorial for beginners is extremely helpful and made the learning curve interesting and easy to grasp all the different options and mechanics. 

- Negotiate with your friends to form non-aggression agreements, or peace treaties. 
- Persuade your Allies to go to war with your enemies. 
- Have children, arrange a marriage at 18, make him become prince one day. 
- Micro-management, but turn by turn system lets you figure it out at your own pace. 
- The Music and Sound is great. 
-Graphics are par but I blame my PC specs. 
- Battles will have you sit on the edge of your seat, very fun to control and watch. 
- Every decision you make can impact your relationships within your empire and other factions around you. 
- Family Corruption
-Family Jealousy

There's a lot here, and I'm only 8 hours in at this point of the review.

but......... this total war  is something can't be ignored, 
epic duels,
satisfying music
court and governing system
diplomacy system works more positive than the ex total war series,
equip your generals with looted gears/weapons/decoration/followers 
Campaign AI is much smarter and cunning in both diplomacy and in war, also looks  way out when in tight situations, by making alliance or vassalage to other strong factions, to overcome your power or offering vassalage to you,

Actually, if i stay and tell all the wonderful features then I will need a huge page to fill in hahaha

Stat changes =/= actual difficulty, it just makes sim battles the only way to win, because those stats either aren't considered, or aren't weighted properly. Have an identical army to your enemy? You're going to lose, period. Your units will route easily and do little to no damage. Better bring two and leave it to the win button.

Honestly, for a game with such stellar mechanics otherwise, I don't know how they keep getting this wrong. Every. Single. Game. Warhammer 2 is the same way, but at least there's unit diversity there to distract you from it. There are very very few unique units in this game, and the ones that do exist are about 4x the cost of their generic counterparts for maybe 10% increased effectiveness, so you won't use them unless you love losing.

All in all, disappointing. It's sad that we still have to use the mantra of ""Modders pls fix.""",1562722825,1562722825,False,0.523809552192687988,True,False,False,183,en

Just random crashes happening randomly its always something different. I cannot pinpoint it. Have requested help but to no avail. Really wish I could play without constant setbacks. Anyways I was not going to write a review but the crashing just irks me.
All of the units are pretty samey, but i guess(?) that makes sense. That also does seem to change mid to late game where a couple of the factions get unique units. Its all china anyways.
They cut out alot of the animations, like rocks being loaded on trebuchet
The gore dlc seems half-assed, not alot of mutilation, weird blood stains, not alot of blood (there is an option for it to turn up but it really just paints the whole unit)
Maybe I am dumb, but only Romance mode in online battles??? 
Really great to play after reading the book, or watching one of the shows. I love seeing my favorite character and charging him into battle. I wish there was more romance in the romance mode, like remember when Zhao Yun was carrying a baby and fought off like five thousand soldiers and tore down a whole wall with his bare hands?

I recommend only if you like this period of time in China!

- Worst offender here is the voiced loading screens which also require you to press continue. After hearing them nearly 70 hours makes my head explode. There are only couple of different variants and they repeat every time you load your game or just do anything which warrants the loading screen
- You get TRAITOR penalty for helping your vassals in the war and you get TRAITOR penalty for not helping them in war.
- AI retreating from battles even with force march mode on.
- No strategic nor tactical depth in the battle system. Just a straight line and after that it becomes retreat -> rally -> retreat -> rally micromanagement on all around the battle map RTS game style
- AI can siege your towns without declaring war on you forcing you to be the aggressor if you want to defend your city and possibly getting traitor penalty if you had treaties with them
- AI has no trustworthiness rating, it can betray and do anything without penalties
- And many more, all similar to those and how player is penalized even if the AI breaks treaties 

Subjective negative point
- Looks like there isn't much of modding community around this game. Not like in Rome 2 or Warhammer. No major mods on the horizon, unless they are hidden in some Chinese site

I would still give it a positive vote since it's enjoyable even after those.

In terms of gameplay, this feels like a game that can happily sit alongside my love for the Warhammer TW games. It's less asynchronous than Warhammer was (which can be good or bad depending on your flavour) but it absolutely bolsters the diplomacy, mechanics and characters dynamics throughout.
