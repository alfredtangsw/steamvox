1256,Tactical Gameplay,"Great graphics, art style and one of the smoothest gameplay for a Total War game at launch.

The Chinese voice overs (enable it in menu) are really good but the battle taunts get repetitive after 1 hour and you'll likely want to disable that function.

For the faction choices, there are quite a few factions to choose from. I think you would like it more if you know stuff about the Three Kingdoms period because you can then play as your favourite characters. For their unique units, buildings and abilities, there are sufficient differences for some characters. The Yellow Turbans have a different technology system and unit roster as compared to the rest.

For the campaign map, it is quite big and with varied sceneries to represent the different landscape China has to offer. Though the building system may be somewhat limited due to a rather limited roster and a few ""must have"" buildings, it still works. There's food, trade, population, public order, revolts etc.

The main plus point in the campaign would be diplomacy. It has improved a lot as compared to previous titles, as there are more options to choose from and diplomatic alliances or agreements matter more in this game. The spy system though sometimes useful, can be neglected. Still, there should be changes to better include UI and tooltips regarding administrators, the family tree and recruitment.

For battles, the maps are an upgrade as compared to previous games based on looks. Towers and trebuchets are potent in this game. The tactics used are about the same as other Total War games but in Romance mode, the duels look good and the generals are essentially tanks. A limited unit roster does make gameplay slighty more repetitive sometimes but it's Total War.

Sieges can be quite similar though. Most often it is trebuchet for towers/walls -> archers for towers/units) -> duel to decrease morale (if you win) -> charge and repeat
Granted there are variations of walled town sieges and resource sieges, they roughly play out about the same. Sometimes if you outnumber the AI in artilery they would charge out in resource battles which makes it easier since they bottleneck at the entrances and with flaming shot for trebuchets it's over.
It's quite fun for the first 100+ times maybe, after that no so. Perhaps more options to use while defending or attacking would help (hot oil down the walls, booby traps, tunneling under walls)

There's a lack of Naval Combat which is a bit sad but then again, it is difficult to put it into this game. Perhaps there can be DLCs which has scenarios that allow naval combat to be implemented (Korea stuff) or there can even be focused maps that make the rivers larger and more important than it is now.

As for character portraits, let's just use mods because other than the few unique characters they're all about the same and it is hard to have as much fun as when you have had the unique characters. Probably an expansion would be put out sometime later.

Overall, if you like China and Chinese history this is a very good game. I bought it at launch and felt that I have enjoyed it enough to warrant the purchase, I think it's one of the more polished and smooth Total War games.

- Very good diplomatic system, much better than the previous titles. It has much bigger impact on the campaign
- Detailed characters classes system with a blend of RPG in term of equipment and relationship.
- Beautiful graphic and great optimization
- Its the ROTK period, and lots of ppl love it just by the settings.

Neutral :
- Combat remain pretty much the same with the Archer > Spear / Melee > Cavalry > Archer system with the addition of characters abilities. Personally, i still prefer the Warhammer titles combat style where we have very diverse armies

Cons :
- Frustrating recruitment / replenishment system. It take really long to replenish army without reform/abilities, and your newly recruited unit does not appear with full model. You actually have to wait a few turns for the new unit to be at full strength. Luckily, all units take only a turn to recruit this time
- Missile feel a bit OP this time with lots of killing power

Diplomacy: If the player chooses, diplomacy can be a much larger part of the campaign compared with previous total war games. 

Battle: Combat is less about Rock Paper Scissors. Archers have greater range and damage potential. Calvary like in recent total war titles are still extremely strong (although fewer in number compared with Atilla and Rome2).

Campaign: I found myself greatly attached to my generals and it is very sad when they finally die of old age at the end of the campaign. Players can choose to follow the story or decide their own path. This is an great addition to total war that provides the game with better immersion. 

Art: Armor and portrayal of characters is more fantasy rather than historical but it is nonetheless pretty impressive. The design of the campaign map and in battle scenery is gorgeous.

a. The Counselors option is cool. A better version than Shogun. We opened a tatami set of doors and have a warlord sitting on his chair in Full Armor. Negotiate, and a spam voice reply. Now we have some feel for a proper ""Court.""
b. Negotiating Diplomacy & trade is detailed and You ARE held accountable for your WORD and actions.
c. CA and Total War should ALL get awards, from gamer's and their fellow game makers/competitors!!!

#2. The details are Insane and AWESOME! During battle I was chasing down some broken soldiers. Cavalry ran over a farmer. She was knocked to the ground! The affect of the war in China is serious! Her companions!? Just kept walking to the fields! 

#3. As for the required attention to detail and comprehensive building browser and settlement management? BRAVO!
You want to be a Lord!? Then Lord over your EMPIRE! Kingdom! Fiefdom! whatever!? 
Sit back, listen to the music. Zoom in to your settlements and LISTEN! Are the people laughing and having conversations? Or is there chaos and hunger!?
Is your weapons craftsman working and his apprentice fueling the furnace!? Are the trade routes busy? Roads have traffic? 
Or do you have Yellow Turbans running about!? 
I LOVE the Nerdy necessities to detail! 
If you just want to build and fight wars!? Your welcome to explore the google universe!

Finally! If you're thinking of Buying #Total War: Three Kingdoms!? Buy it! Love it! 

Again, Thank You. 

p.s. I DO want a full Royal COURT animation and interactive CHARACTERS that will ADVISE me and even CHALLENGE my decisions and orders. Personality!? WAR or Diplomacy!? Sneaky or Blunt? You DO give us plenty of character interaction. Yes, with text boxes and AWESOME artwork! OMG! the Artwork! It's NOT pictures and postcards! IT""S ART!!!!!!!!

I saw this game watching the youtuber Oversimplified, who explained the backstory etc. I thought this would be a cool game. So once i received enough money for this game i bought it. So far the game is definitely in my Top 3 Total War Games of all time. I do not know if it will break my love and passion for Shogun 2, but in my opinion it has beaten most.

673,Series Authenticity,"I would say choosing between this and Total Warhammer II comes down to whether you prefer the pseudo-historic setting of this or the futuristic one from WH40k.

Three Kingdoms is a quite competent Total War game. As far the historic ones go I'd argue it's the best, on-par with Shogun II post-expansions, if lighter on content since it's still new. It has interesting unique systems like recruits being dependent on general type, far better diplomacy, spying. It allows you to pick whether you want a more Dynasty Warriors style ""romance"" or a more Total War ""records"" mode. It has characters from the lore, if you're into the Three Kingdoms era. Its combat mechanics have some neat twists, including a surprisingly real scarcity of money and hence a focus on cheap mass over sparse substance (other than the army-slaughtering generals in records mode).

Recommended! It's not perfect, of course. Options could be better, performance could be better, asking 3?? for the blood-effects DLC is just silly, the ""introduction"" character is actually one of the hardest to play.

Food is very important, your armies have supplies now which will run out if you have them on endless marches, if supplies run out you will face desertion. I also think the AI is a lot better in this campaign, I find it will try to gather its armies and will try and bait me more often. It just seems to make less stupid choices.

I play on records mode and have found the battles to be very enjoyable. The AI does not make too many stupid decisions, mostly. It did just randomly charge its right flank of cavalry at me ahead of its core which was quickly cut down by my whole army. This was only one time and it was quite funny to watch.

Performance wise the game is amazing. I have an I7 6700, GTX 1070 and 16 GB of DDR4 Ram. I play on Ultra settings. I get 60 fps constantly with no issues. The only time I every lost frames was during a huge battle with 4 armies but come on what do you expect, I did only drop down to 40 fps so it was still perfectly playable. The graphics are good, there is a heavy reliance of depth of field effects but it does not really bother me.

2739,Series Authenticity,"An incredible return to the historical roots of the series. The revamped diplomatic system presents players to explore other play-styles beyond your typical full-stack armies hopping from one enemy province to the next. Coalitions are encouraged, if not always a necessity, and the introduction of multiple trade-able is a welcome addition to help mix things up from previous titles. Want to stockpile food to sell to the rest of China at an inflated price? You now can!

I didn't think I would enjoy Romance mode, as I wasn't a fan of Warhammer and it's powerful generals, magic, monsters etc. But I'm happy to say that I love it and the heroes/characters. Racking up several hundred kills with a general can be very rewarding but with a risk - they are not indestructible. I have lost a number of powerful and significant characters as I was too busy micro-managing cavalry elsewhere on the map. Read beware: if you're not careful, you characters will die.

I suppose that is a bit of a statement about the era. A tumultuous time where any slight mistake can have disastrous consequences and it is that raising of the stakes that makes the game so much more enjoyable and re-playable. I had no prior interest in the Ancient China but - as is the way with Total War games - I have now done bits of reading here and there to learn about the period and the main players involved. Fascinating stuff.

Ultimately, this is by far my favourite of the series to date. Shogun II sat atop that throne and I honestly was not expecting it to be usurped by 3K. I was wrong. The king is dead; long live the king.

-Great focus on characters. Extensive skilltrees, opinions, rivalries, marriages, kids, etc. CKII of Total War :)
-Diplomacy that actually works and makes sense, First time in TW history (not counting mods)
-Great optimisation - no crashes and gamebreaking bugs since day 1, also  - modest AI turn times (until very-very lategame)
-Big map and lots of factions allow generally longer campaigns than in other TW games

So-so:

-Battles are just Atilla:Total War with added character-heroes. If you liked combat in Atilla, you will like this. If you prefer other TW's combat, you might be disappointed a bit

Cons:

-No Workshop (yet)
-Story component is weaker than it should be. Each faction have only 1 short ark and it will pass in like 5% of the game. For rest of the campagn - only random events, which are rare and dont make sense sometimes (family relocation being perfect example)
-Trailer music is great, battle music is ok, but strategic map music...of all classic Chinese motives they somehow picked the WORST. Its really annoying. For the first time I turned off music in TW game after first few hours
-Map is big, but contains some VERY questionable gamedesign decisions. I mean it was in TW before, but there it is on the scale of epic proportions - like, a two towns from same commandery on DIFFERENT sides of a big impassable mountain, each having towns from OTHER commanderies nearby?! ffs, this thing kills all immersion and pretense of realism

CA have really outdone themselves with this game, from launch it's ran smoothly for me with no problems at all, playing on max settings I never seem to dip below 70 FPS, even during intense battles. The A.I (for the most part) seems decent, although they do appear to be able to spawn multiple armies out of nowhere even when they've had their economy badly damaged. I've not encountered a single bug in nearly 30 hours of game-play which for a total war game on launch is extremely impressive, although I have heard of some bugs from others (and some which have been patched as of this review). The game can sometimes be overwhelming towards the end with the amount of enemies you have to fight at once, but I thought the challenge really added to the game more than it took away. 
I seriously recommend this game to total war fans, and newer players alike since it's really easy to get in to, but with enough new material for older fans to enjoy. 

TLDR: While scores don't necessarily matter, i'd give three kingdoms a solid 8/10 and would highly encourage you to try it for yourself.

The diplomacy and campaign AI (omitting army chasing) have made for some of the best total war experiences I've had in the series.

Might be fun if I didn't spend the entire game chasing around armies that were in constant retreat. Wasting time while my cities fell. This is a game flaw that has been around since almost the first in the series.

2055,Tactical Gameplay,"I'll start off by saying I started playing the Total War series with Warhammer I then II.  Therefore, I can't speak of how poorly or well this game relates to anything prior.  I've always been a huge fan of the fantasy genre and absolutely love the Warhammer series so I figured I'd give this a shot as I'm also intrigued by the Romance series.

This game certainly does not disappoint.  It is evident the diplomacy has been revamped.  I like every aspect better than that of the aforementioned series.  There is a ""Quick Deal"" button that shows you all of the known factions and whether or not they'll accept said offer.  Saves a lot of time as opposed to going through each faction individually.  There is a lot that goes into the diplomacy as well.  Vassals, War, Trade among other topics all have their own diplomacy tab, just to give you an idea of the depth.

The gameplay is similar to that of Warhammer, and I'm assuming the rest of the franchise.  I was skeptical of there not being a wide enough variety of troops to keep me interested (Battle-wise) as I was likely spoiled with the fantasy genre of Warhammer.  There are a good number of unit variations as you progress through the skill tree with 1 or 2 ""Special"" units per Leader.  There is some variance between Leaders as well.  Each seem to have their own agenda and playstyle, which changes things up some.

The city control, settlement building, unit movement and recruitment are all basically the same to the previous title.  The only thing I had trouble initially grasping was that of the ""Satisfaction"" of each city. I got that it was basically the Public Order but was not aware of the ""Corruption"".  I was frustrated that I was capturing cities, farms, ports etc yet losing income every turn...  Increasingly so.  Finally realized and discovered how corruption is so important and was able to mediate it on my subsequent playthrough.  

With all of this being said, even with over 700hrs of gameplay on Warhammer II alone, there was still a relatively steep learning curve as I wasn't familiar with previous installments.  There were many things, including my economy (As previously stated), reasons why one faction became upset with me when all signs pointed to what should've been a positive outcome, along with certain battle instances where the AI Cavalry decimated my Spearmen.  I still have some head scratchers but ultimately I feel it's a well polished game.

I purposely waited until I gave the game a fair shake to write this review because there were and are still some things I'll have to wait to find out.  Currently I have just over 70hrs logged and I'm on my 3rd try.  My first play I chose Cao Cao.  I ultimately had alliances and friends all over the map.  There was no where and nothing to do unless I wanted to become ""Untrustworthy"" and start wars with allies.  I chose to restart as Lui Bei.  This is where the economy crippled me.  I was about 1k in the green then went to war with Ma Teng.  Conquered his territory along with what was remaining from the Han Dynasty and ended up -7K....  Minus SEVEN THOUSAND.  WTF reset.  This time I'm playing as Gongsun Zan.  Doing well but nearly to the point of my Cao Cao campaign.  Just became Emperor so I lost a few friends along the way.  I have a good economy and grip on the Northeast.  I do feel as though I've gotten a better feel for the game and its mechanics now.  I'm only saying this because I'm sure this game will be off-putting because the tutorial isn't great and there is so much involved.  Things won't come easy but when they click, they click.

One last thing I'd like to touch on, which is a great plus for this game is the espionage.  There are a ton of options along 4 chains of actions for your spy to perform.  All require faction points, which are accrued by turn and spy points which are accrued by that individual spy.  Which options are available depend on the position your spy attains while embedded in that faction.  If they lead a military force, they can perform actions that give you line of sight or even hinder or defect that force.  One pleasant surprise on my Cao Cao play through was that my spy was appointed as Sun Jian's family member.  My spy developed such close ties that Sun Jian adopted him.  At that point, once I accrued the necessary amount of points, I assassinated the heir, Sun Ce.  Spies can also defect and change sides and you might also have to face them in battle.  I had to face one in battle and they retreated early but I ensured I focused on the other two generals so I didn't kill my own.  The possibility of spies also adds a cautious side to my tactics.  I'm currently skeptical of SIma Yi's intentions.  I know he was always close with Lui Bei but suddenly he comes to me...  He asks for a higher court position, which I know would give him more accessibility in my faction but do I want to risk losing such a good general??  We'll see but I'd rather not banish his ass lol.

So much intrigue and so much that has been different on my 3 campaigns.

2294,Tactical Gameplay,"TLDR: If you're a veteran of the TW games, if you like RTWP battles, and/or if you like empire building 4X games, buy it.  It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. 

Wordier version: If you've played any of the Total War games this should feel pretty familiar to you. At the same time, there are some significant changes that mark it as a different beast than both the standard 'historical' TW games and the Warhammer games. Some of the changes are great, some... not so great. It's still tasty, though.  Even if you haven't played TW games this is worth a buy since it's a hugely fun beasty that's pretty easy to learn. I'll break down the specifics below. 

Pros: 
[list]
    [*]The game is gorgeous and the art style really hits its mark. 
    [*] It runs very smoothly. Even when there were a bunch of factions running around the map, it didn't take anywhere near as long for the computer to go through turns as it did in the Warhammer games. I also has low load times for its quick-save and quick-load system. 
    [*]Unit statistics are now much more granular; units don't just have an 'attack' and a 'defense' value, they have different defensive abilities vs missle and meele attacks, and so on. They most likely existed on previous games but were hidden, but TWTK makes them explicit. 
[*] While there are pretty generic troop roles and there aren't really faction specific units, there is enough variation in the types of spearmen you can field, for example, that only very basic army configurations seem 'samey'. The end game units feel properly epic.  
[*] The addition of duels to the Romance mode is excellent! I thought it was gimicky when I first read about it, but it works really well in the game  (although not all enemy generals will agree to a duel) 
[*] Having different classes of generals actually works really well and makes you consider what type of composition you'd like. You can have a set of dueling / brawling monsters, but without a support general, you won't be able to initiate night battles, which are absolutely essential in many situations. 
[*] Paper-doll style inventory; you can change a general's weapon, armor, mount, follower, and item. It's a nifty system that I found myself liking a lot. 
[/list]

Meh: 
[list]
[*] Armies no longer have one leader, they're broken up into a maximum of three mini-armies that fit together into one larger army, each mini-army (called a retinue) is led by one general. In practice that means that you will have some generals with abilities that affect the whole army, and some that just affect their individual retinue. It can be annoying to have a bunch of melee units, half of whom are pretty fast because one general has an ability that boosts his retinue's speed, and another half that are noticably slower. Keeping your entire army in formation and/or timing charges properly is much more difficult as a result. 
[*] Management - while the game technically has provinces, you can only really do anything with them if you assign a general to them as an administrator. And you can only have a small number of admins. And admins cost additional upkeep. 
[*] It takes new units an amount of time to muster. So even after you've spent the cash to buy a new set of troops, you'll need to wait several turns while the new units fill up, pretty much using the same mechanics as if you were replenishing damaged units. It's... odd. 
[*] You need to complete research in order to build most buildings above a very basic tier, and you need to have built buildings up to a basic tier in order to do further research down their branch. It's a very odd way of doing things and it's a bit annoying to be locked out of certain buildings until you research the right prerequisites. 
[*] There isn't enough information to differentiate how some units' functions are different. For instance, there's a missile unit in the game whose function is listed as ""bombardment"" and one that's listed as ""suppression"".  Some melee units have the tag of ""assault"" and others ""front line"". What are ""bombardment"" and ""suppression"", how does an ""assault"" unit differ from a ""front line"" unit? Fuck if I know, and there doesn't seem to be any tooltips for those sorts of role descriptors. I suppose you could try looking it up in the glossary, but that gets real annoying real fast. 
[*] Your generals are evidently pretty darn picky about everybody else in the game, and will have some pretty strong personal feelings about everybody else they could possibly be paired up with in an army. There are times when you absolutely need to reinforce an army with a particular general and their retinue, but then all the generals in the army will get all pissed off at each other. Hell, this even happens in your faction's court - the wife of my faction's leader ended up hating her own son.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]. 
    [*]Diplomacy. Holy shit, diplomacy. there are a million and one factions crammed into a pretty small space and they all have pretty strong opinions on pretty much everything you might do with one of the other factions. Plus, evidently everybody and their sister has decided that getting/becoming vassals is the way to do things. And then there's the Trustworthyness system. Some of it is old hat for TW players, like if you have a non-aggression pact with a nation and then immediately break it and declare war, you'll be viewed as less than trustworthy by the other factions. But remember that I mentioned vassals are now much more important? Well... sooner or later your vassal(s) will be attacked and you'll have the option of defending them and losing trustworthyness or abandoning them... and losing trustworthyness and a vassal to boot. Defending your vassals against wars of aggression should *not* lose you the respect of other factions.  
    [*]Trade; The way the economics of the game stack up, you will absolutely need to set up trade pacts and/or vassals to have any hope of fielding a proper number of armies.   But unlike previous TW games, you have a very limited number of trade pacts that you can make and saving slots often doesn't make sense since the other factions have a very limited number of slots too, and they tend to fill up very quickly. 
[*] Egos - characters are generally not at all happy just leading an army. Oh no, they want increased honors, titles, offices in the realm, and for you to take them out on date-nights more often (okay, that last bit isn't true). But they will throw a fit and storm off, leaving your faction, if you don't stroke their egos. Some character traits make this worse, and some will dull their ambition, but most of them have some sort of desire for bigger and better.  Well, those titles and offices cost money. Lots of money. 
[*] Agents... there aren't any. Assassins, spies, diplomats, etc, are all gone. Now you only have a limited number of slots for spies, and they have to be your generals that you then lose the ability to use since they become embedded with the enemy in their court or their armies. I also couldn't figure out any way to recall them, so once you've made a general into a spy,  it looks like they're gone forever. You can duplicate some of the functions that spies served in the previous TW games, but you need to build up two different types of 'spy points' (whatever they call 'em) in order to complete most actions, and it takes multiple turns to build up those points. Each different class of general also only has the option to use certain types of spy actions. While assassination may be possible (I'm honestly not sure), I didn't see it in my options lists. There's also the fact that your spies have a disturbingly common tendency to defect to the factions that you've embedded them in. In those situations, the game will tell you that your spy is in imminent danger of being converted by the faction its embedded with and warn you that you need to secure their loyalty, but then there's pretty much no mechanic to actually do that.

3467,Series Authenticity,"[b] An excellent showing from CA [/b] 

As a veteran total war player, I felt that the franchise was becoming too streamlined and i was worried what would become of Total War after it had completed the Warhammer trilogy, especially with the disappointing Thrones of  Britannia and the delays for this game. 

Thankfully, the game exceeded my expectations and although I have played this for only 6 hours at the time of writing this, I can say with confidence that this is up there with Rome and Medieval 2.

The most major upgrade is without doubt diplomacy. With the near absence of natural obstacles and lots of potential enemies it has become very important to manage your relations with other powers. The presence of a ""Make this Work"" button is also a great improvement to diplomacy and thus it makes it more fun to play with unlike Warhammer Diplomacy.

The role of Commanders in romance mode is also a neat feature. I loved watching my best warrior fighting a duel with an enemy champion whilst both armies simply watched, making the combat all the more satisfying. Also, the level of complexity added with managing your subordinates is another much welcomed feature.

The mustering, supplying and food mechanics from Thrones make a return with much needed improvements but I feel that I can't go into more detail since I didn't buy Thrones so you may want to compare the systems mentioned in both games to know what I'm talking about.

I can also say that the AI has improved, at least on the campaign map and from what I have seen. In my Cao Cao playthrough, my enemy seized  my livestock farm but with heavy looses and I was poised to strike with a fresh force to retake it. Realising this, the AI army abandoned the farm and went into ambush mode to become hidden and avoid destruction.

I also really like that CA also listened to fan complaints about the game prior to the delays and gave us extreme unit sizes and alternative unit cards, it is much appreciated. I also love the fact that after playing one playthrough, you are encouraged to do another one as the option to play as Dong Zhou is unlocked. 

I do have a few gripes with the game such as the limited trade options and the bad U.I for diplomacy but on the whole it is a excellent game worth playing. It is nothing like previous total war games and i really want to see the features introduced to future total wars, particularly Warhammer 3. It fully deserves my score of 9/10.

There's so many playstyles you can go with one playthrough or another playthrough of this game it not repetitive at all. Currently, I am playing the Pokemon game of catching all the generals to create the most elite force ancient China has ever seen before working together.

I am just hoping they can release the Blood & Gore DLC very soon to spice up battles a bit. It almost seems mandatory now in Total War games to have blood and gore, without it seems very bland in my opinion.

People who grew up playing Koei's Dynasty Warriors will love this game. Various modders from previous Total War games will love the chance to create new mods for this game as well. 

Soon, there will be mod tools available and the amount of potentially amazing mods will be there for all who bought this game the chance to really play their own style.

2604,Tactical Gameplay,"I haven't liked any of the historical titles since Shogun 2. The simplified economic system and change to general only commanded armies were difficult changes for me. I enjoyed the Total Warhammer series for the fantasy aspect and the tweaks they made, but that series also suffered from the same issues. Now with Three Kingdoms they seemed to have significantly improved and balanced these systems pretty well. The changes are definitely something to get used to. I was pretty upset at first because it's quite a lot to take in. Don't be so hasty to cast judgement and want  a refund though. Play it through until you get a good understanding of how the new systems play together. The way they implement the family, diplomacy, economy, and espionage are awesome. It's hard to find good hero's for traits that keep them satisfied with lower court positions. So keep that in mind. 

??Armies have improved in that the heroes are just captain units that can command a retinue of up to six other units. Each Army can consist of up to 6 other units. These units should match their heroes style, which is color coded for different character values, personalities, and starting skills. 

??Diplomacy is the best that it has ever been. It just makes sense. Having Cao Cao helps significantly with his skills too because he can use his passive credibility points to sway relations or instigate wars.

??Economy is back to a complex system of different buildings, government reforms, and the characters you use in government and court appointments like commandery assignments and administrative positions. It's heavily based on population growth and planning. I'm still on my first run and I built too many farms at first. I didn't feel like demolishing them so I started selling the excess to other factions that were poor, very poor, or negative on food in the diplomacy menu. 
With trade restricted from conflict and borders, this became an excellent source of income for 10 turns at a time. 

??Reforms come every 5 turns and allow you to advance your skills and bonuses. These are also how you unlock new troops. Most of the reforms require you to build a certain low level building to start the branch. You can build them and then convert them, or demolish them to rebuild a different type as a work around if you don't have the building space but want to unlock that branch of ""technology"". I had to do this with the county school to unlock the underground network. Which is the espionage system.

??The Underground Network is the replacement for agents, subterfuge, and sabotage. You assign specific heroes from your pool of court nobles or new recruits to embed themselves in another factions army. It can be annoying at first because there's no instant gratification of having an agent open the gates or stop and army dead in their tracks. But it does add an entire layer of enjoyable play carefully planning your tactics. Your character will try to enlist themselves in the other faction. If they succeed, then they'll begin building cover points and underground network points specific to them and that faction. These numbers can be boosted by using the two skills in the first menu. It's a difficult change, but very enjoyable once you understand it. (there is one issue with not being able to recall your character at the time of this review. You have to use larceny or a military revolt to recover your hero. That is unless they get caught.)

I think this is the best Total War to date in my opinion. The only people I would say to stay away are the ones who want a more realistic approach. Some people are calling it dynasty warriors because the heroes can be overpowered against non-hero units in battle. If you don't mind that approach, much like Total Warhammer series, then buy this game.",0.777899981,"['historical_titles', 'shogun_two', 'change', 'general', 'army', 'change', 'total_warhammer', 'series', 'fantasy', 'aspect', 'tweak', 'series', 'issue', 'three_kingdoms', 'change', 'cast', 'judgement', 'refund', 'way', 'family', 'diplomacy', 'economy', 'espionage', 'heros', 'trait', 'court', 'position', '??armie', 'hero', 'captain', 'unit', 'command', 'retinue', 'unit', 'army', 'unit', 'unit', 'hero', 'style', 'color', 'character', 'value', 'personality', 'skill', 'makes_sense', 'cao_cao', 'skill', 'credibility', 'point', 'sway', 'relation', 'war', 'building', 'government', 'reform', 'character', 'government', 'court', 'commandery', 'assignment', 'position', 'population', 'growth', 'planning', 'run', 'farm', 'faction', 'food', 'diplomacy', 'menu', 'trade', 'conflict', 'border', 'source', 'income', '10_turns', '??reform', 'turn', 'advance', 'skill', 'bonus', 'troop', 'reform', 'level', 'building', 'branch', 'convert', 'demolish', 'type', 'work', 'building', 'space', 'unlock', 'branch', 'technology', 'county', 'school', 'network', 'espionage', 'network', 'replacement', 'agent', 'sabotage', 'hero', 'pool', 'court', 'recruit', 'faction', 'army', 'gratification', 'agent', 'gate', 'army', 'track', 'layer', 'play', 'tactic', 'character', 'enlist', 'faction', 'cover', 'point', 'network', 'point', 'faction', 'number', 'skill', 'change', 'issue', 'recall', 'character', 'review', 'use', 'revolt', 'recover', 'hero', 'best_total_war_date', 'opinion', 'people', 'approach', 'people', 'dynasty_warriors', 'hero', 'nonhero', 'unit', 'battle', 'mind', 'approach', 'total_warhammer', 'series', 'buy']",151,"['sabotage', 'tactic', 'use', 'government', 'gate', 'battle', 'position', 'technology', 'recover', 'makes_sense', 'buy', 'conflict', 'general', 'heros', 'value', 'personality', 'point', 'building', 'total_warhammer', 'unit', '??reform', 'opinion', 'fantasy', 'play', 'dynasty_warriors', 'espionage', 'growth', 'assignment', 'reform', '10_turns', '??armie', 'historical_titles', 'refund', 'level', 'commandery', 'command', 'food', 'diplomacy', 'cao_cao', 'demolish', 'county', 'issue', 'space', 'cover', 'aspect', 'recall', 'shogun_two', 'retinue', 'menu', 'replacement', 'school', 'mind', 'army', 'run', 'captain', 'way', 'layer', 'relation', 'type', 'troop', 'source', 'faction', 'judgement', 'hero', 'cast', 'court', 'unlock', 'style', 'convert', 'series', 'income', 'agent', 'number', 'branch', 'skill', 'color', 'revolt', 'enlist', 'trait', 'family', 'character', 'advance', 'farm', 'economy', 'network', 'track', 'people', 'work', 'planning', 'change', 'three_kingdoms', 'recruit', 'bonus', 'trade', 'credibility', 'pool', 'nonhero', 'tweak', 'war', 'sway', 'turn', 'review', 'best_total_war_date', 'approach', 'population', 'border', 'gratification']",107,"unit, battle, faction, army, general, character, diplomacy, campaign, hero, building",1

100,Tactical Gameplay,"I have played all the Total war games except the original Shogun and Medieval and this is the first one i actually finished a grand campaign in! 

Pros:
+ Since every faction is using almost the same units, the game only ever feels as unfair as your starting location/strength

+ I love the romance mode, it really adds flavour to what could otherwise be quite a bland game (Though Shogun 2 is great, i 
always tire of seeing the same units fight all the time)

+ The game never gets ""too easy"". As you grow bigger, all the other factions grow bigger with you and/or form coalitions to counter you. This prevents you from steamrolling up until the final stage of the game.

+ Really cool maps! Both the battle maps and the campaign map look really nice and offer unique gameplay experiences.

Cons:
- I miss boats. All the recent total war titles have neglected naval warfare and this is no exception. I really miss the playstyle opportunities that came with naval units. (Playing as GB in Empire, Carthage in Rome or Boat-clan in Shogun)

- Duels feel quite boring. When i read about duels i was really excited and tought they looked awesome, but after playing the actual game i feel like they are an option i just never want to use. If your commander is stronger then you want to duel but the enemy doesnt want to and if you are weaker then there is no point in dueling.

Overall:
Currently my favorite Total war game, but i feel it lacks the replayability of the games with bigger faction differences (Rome or Warhammer)

2042,Tactical Gameplay,"I have played every single Total War game since Shogun 1- so you might say I am a little biased. But, holy crap- CA has done it again. They made a product that is engaging, fun, and unique throughout every gameplay mechanic. Three Kingdoms does a masterful job of making you feel as if you're a leader trying to create a name for their family and faction in the vast sea that is Three Kingdoms China. 

New mechanics add a layer of depth that the Total War series was lacking.  From the characters you put in your armies according to the ""harmony/disharmony mechanic"" to receive stat bonuses for campaign and battle maps, to the governorship's you might appoint according to those that are loyal and industries, but might not be the best warriors for the front-lines. This makes characters feel unique with their own backstory- all explored through the easy to navigate UI.

Battle Mechanics are solid- as is with most every Total War game. To some of the more historical inclined Total War veterans the battles will feel faster, with most battles being between 5 to 8 minutes- with longer battles coming close to 10 to 12 minutes. This can be off putting to some- but to others it will be a welcome change that makes it less likely of an ""auto-resolve"". The game also runs at a smooth 40 fps with everything on ultra and having over 5,000 units on the battle map.

Meanwhile, the Campaign Map is absolutely gorgeous. From the windy snowy peaks of mountain ranges, to the water lapping on the eastern coastal shores, to the green pastures that change with every season- the map will be a treat to the eyes. I did have a slight issue when scrolled all the way out with some FPS drop- and I know it isn't due to my computer. This can easily be fixed with a later patch as it isn't game breaking- just more of any annoyance.

Improvements:
+Great optimization, game runs very well
+Story events are faithful to the traumatic period of Three Kingdoms and characters are very well fleshed out 
+The Chinese voice acting is phenomenal
++Gameplay and AI is varied, every playthrough feels different
+++Deep town building and character management. Winning battles is only half the victory, better kingdom management will go a long way in winning the war.
+++Diplomacy that works and makes sense! This is a rarity in strategy games these days.

Now the not so good...
-English voice acting isn't the best
-Not much improvement in AI during battles
-The world map can be a confusing mess as everything can seem blended together

Closing thoughts:
This is the best Total War after Warhammer. I hope CA keeps some of the improvements(notably the diplomacy and the kingdom management) for their future titles.

Now let's just give some context to just how good this game is. 

-Immersive game world
-rich narative driven historical setting
-based on one of the oldest novels ever
-it's actually fucking well optimised. A total war game that's well optimised. Never thought i'd see the day.
-It looks good, and it knows where to cut corners to make it run well. 
-this is the first tw game to launch with an above 70% score since shogun 2
-you can send three dudes in to kill everyone
-you can play like a normal total war game with a general leading an army.
-you can play with a new mode that makes your characters superhuman as if they were from the romance novels. 
-I love this game, and i loved rome 2 at launch, hell i've got 1400 hours in that damn hellhole bugs and all. 
-no landship bug. 

now for some problems because nothing is perfect. 

-pathing can be a bit iffy.
-i miss matched combat.
-the economy system can feel a bit harsh sometimes.
-it still suffers the old alt+tab bugs of yestergames 
-it doesn't take much for a warlord to steamroll over other ai. 

honestly i want to have more negative to say else this feels too biased, but i genuinely cannot find too many faults in this game. I love it and i'm not even the biggest fan of CA's newer TW titles. Thrones and both warhammers were ok, but somehow they combined the two and made this masterpiece.

3516,Series Authenticity,"After 80 hours which isn't many but since you take into consideration that I work and have a family they are many, so I will be commenting a bit more intensively about the game.

As a new player, you will be thrown down a lot of new aspects in a total war that you haven't seen before but worry not! this total war has one of the greatest tutorials ever in a total war game, not many have mentioned it as probably a lot of players aren't new here around but the possibility to click the exclamation mark and go directly to a video made by one of the developers telling you how that mechanic is working it's really nice! so props to them.

Also before we go to the more in-depth review I wanted to comment something about the price of the game and future DLC's, yes guys this it's a 60$ game but think how many hours have you spend in it? it's cheaper to play than to go and see a movie as each hour of a movie in my country it's  between 4/6 $ an hour and so far for this game with 80 hours played means I expended 0,56$ for each hour I have put into it since I bought the game for around 45$ in an official reseller. Since this game has no micro I understand CA with the bleeding content of DLC's after all they have to pay their employees... Some of the content that they release surely should be a part of the game but let's put something straight here, every single of you knows what's gonna happen when you buy a game like this.  Many other games which are f2p or p2b (Warframe/newly arrived Conquerors blade even monster hunter world) gets monetized one way or another but from my experience, this total war has been one of the most worth to date as a naked release. 

Now let's go with the review:

Positive aspects of the game:

+Graphics ( the game might not be as awesome as WH1/2 but surely will work better as the performance hit is much less than WH) meaning it can run in older computers

+Newly implemented spies system ( many doesn't know how it works but it's awesome once you learn the way ;).  )

+Heroe duels

+Battles (The maps are awesome, battles are fast I would say a bit slower than in WH)

+Diplomacy (makes this game feel alive)

+It has co-op ( although it could be improved)

+Two different modes to play the game: Records and Romance

+Replayability 

+Workshop for TW games it's awesome! thanks, modders <3


Negative aspects of the game: 

-Battles (AI can be retarded sometimes and defeated easily once you cheese it out but for the majority of players won't be like this)

-Balance (some factions were op but they are being worked out to get balanced)

-Diplomacy ( some people will get annoyed when so many interactions are sent to you I personally love this.)

-Units (the majority of the units are the same, although they will add more as time progresses in any case I do not expect so many changes between factions as it's a historical game not fantasy like WH)


From all the negative aspects the worse is the AI (I'm an experienced TW player and other RTS) although it's challenging it could be better  I only hope that someday people can implement Machine learning  into the TW series as it has happened with Dota, to get a proper AI player but we are miles away from it to happen. 

Now the choice is yours to buy the game, I personally do not regret it compared to other games I bought recently and I think this game it's awesome even if it's not perfect!  An awesome and great RTS for this year.

If you think the price it's too expensive for you I recommend to wait for sales but definitely, this game should be a buy if you like RTS.

1806,Tactical Gameplay,"This is the most painful kind of game to review: One that has so many cool features and really good ideas that add to the series in interesting ways, enhance the gameplay, and represent significant improvements to Total War in many respects... but that suffers from some brutal and unpleasant flaws that make the game too un-fun to actually play.

The improved diplomacy is great. The character system and everything around it are awesome. China is cool, and all the effort put into the Chinese everything is very impressive, and very fun to turn on the Chinese dialogue options. The campaign gameplay has received some much-needed complexity and cool mechanics, building on the Rome 2 system with additions like population complexities, and for the first time since Rome 1 having a coherent, functional, and fun Crusader Kings-like family tree/marriage/faction management system.

But oh man. Oh man oh man oh man.

The battles... maybe it's just me, but they ain't great. Warhammer (understandably) simplified a lot of the tactical combat, but that simplified and frankly arcadey flow feels out of place here, even in the larger-than-life Romance mode. For the first time in a long time, Yoda's back with his army of clones, which is super jarring after all the work that was put in way back in Medieval 2 to have so much dynamic variation between individual men in a unit.

Town/siege battles just... suck. Again, Warhammer simplified them, and while Three Kingdoms does away with the 2-dimensional wall assault style of Warhammer, that simplified philosophy is still painfully present. Magic super-towers pew-pew the attackers to death while you fight in boring and predictable blobs at pre-set chokepoints that you can't even interact with. Gone are Rome 2's complex fortification system and tactical town layouts; now there's just a few set barricade positions that you click on, and they're pretty useless in their pre-set locations. Tedious and uninteresting.

Troop replenishment is absolute torture. While I'm not sad to see some of the ridiculous troop regen from Warhammer gone, now it's too far in the opposite direction, at least in the cases I saw. I think I was in danger of my generals dying of old age before my units would have replenished to full strength. Turn after turn after turn has to be spent just clicking end turn so you can get pathetic handfuls of extra crappy militia troops. I like the return of Britannia's more natural recruitment systems, but it's just painful to interact with in Three Kingdoms.

Some stuff just makes no sense whatsoever. I was BFFs with my faction heir, but in a bad spot for cash, so I decided to take the satisfaction hit and get some extra money from one of the management options. Still BFFs, but now instantly in a civil war for... some reason. Oh, and the general who made up 50% of my (badly depleted, slowly replenishing) army just sort of randomly and arbitrarily appears in my former faction heir's rebel army instead... with fully-replenished, full strength troops! I guess treason makes for good recruitment drives.

The worst sin is the visual presentation in general. For some reason they decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely reinvent the UI and visual style of the series they've been using since Empire, and not for the better. The game is physically painful in terms of finding and reading information that you want or need. I've compared Total War unit stats a thousand times, meticulously checking Melee Attack and Charge Bonus and everything else to figure out what I'm doing... not so easy in Three Kingdoms, on account of the unit stat panel COMPLETELY LACKING DESCRIPTIVE TEXT OF ANY KIND. It's just a noisy mess of incoherent little symbols and stat bars, in complete defiance of the simple, sensible statline readout of every Total War, ever.

That's just one particularly irritating example. The game is lousy with unreadable UI and a frankly kind of ugly presentation. Even the campaign map, which should be a beautiful rendition of China, is kind of lacking compared to Warhammer, and mostly reliant on cheap filters and other post-processing effects to create a visual style. The campaign UI tries a few interesting new ideas but mostly fails, managing to be both ugly and hard to determine what exactly you're looking at. Menus and screens, while in some cases benefiting from a more artistic presentation than just some dry spreadsheet of information, are often obnoxious to find and then subsequently decipher.

So much of the game consists of real, objective steps directly backward in comparison to the rest of the series. Warhammer, despite some of its flaws and simplifications, represented a massive re-invigoration and advancement of the series in so many ways, with Warhammer 2 arguably being CA's best work to date. Three Kingdoms, by contrast, is a mess of ideas, some good, but too many that are stumbling around in an incoherent drunken stupor.",0.763599992,"['kind', 'review', 'idea', 'series', 'way', 'gameplay', 'improvement', 'respect', 'flaw', 'diplomacy', 'character', 'china', 'effort', 'fun', 'dialogue', 'option', 'campaign', 'gameplay', 'complexity', 'mechanic', 'rome', 'addition', 'population', 'complexity', 'rome', 'fun', 'crusader', 'kingslike', 'family', 'treemarriagefaction', 'management', 'battle', 'combat', 'arcadey', 'flow', 'place', 'romance_mode', 'long_time', 'yodas', 'army', 'clone', 'work', 'way', 'variation', 'man', 'unit', 'townsiege', 'battle', 'three_kingdoms', 'wall', 'assault', 'style', 'warhammer', 'philosophy', 'supertower', 'death', 'fight', 'blob', 'chokepoint', 'fortification', 'town', 'layout', 'barricade', 'position', 'location', 'troop', 'replenishment', 'torture', 'troop', 'regen', 'direction', 'case', 'danger', 'general', 'old_age', 'unit', 'strength', 'turn', 'turn', 'end_turn', 'handful', 'militia', 'troop', 'recruitment', 'three_kingdoms', 'stuff', 'makes_sense', 'faction', 'spot', 'cash', 'satisfaction', 'money', 'management', 'option', 'bff', 'civil_war', 'reason', 'army', 'faction', 'heir', 'army', 'strength', 'troop', 'treason', 'recruitment', 'drive', 'sin', 'presentation', 'reason', 'baby', 'bathwater', 'style', 'series', 'empire', 'term', 'information', 'need', 'unit', 'melee', 'attack', 'charge', 'bonus', 'figure', 'three_kingdoms', 'account', 'unit', 'panel', 'text', 'kind', 'mess', 'symbol', 'bar', 'defiance', 'statline', 'example', 'lousy', 'presentation', 'campaign_map', 'rendition', 'china', 'filter', 'effect', 'style', 'campaign', 'idea', 'determine', 'screen', 'case', 'presentation', 'spreadsheet', 'information', 'step', 'comparison', 'rest', 'series', 'flaw', 'simplification', 'reinvigoration', 'advancement', 'series', 'way', 'work', 'date', 'three_kingdoms', 'mess', 'idea', 'stupor']",167,"['text', 'wall', 'fun', 'town', 'civil_war', 'battle', 'clone', 'position', 'example', 'fight', 'stupor', 'treemarriagefaction', 'statline', 'makes_sense', 'campaign_map', 'variation', 'general', 'spot', 'effect', 'location', 'assault', 'replenishment', 'strength', 'melee', 'bar', 'unit', 'option', 'case', 'money', 'torture', 'layout', 'fortification', 'presentation', 'account', 'complexity', 'gameplay', 'supertower', 'respect', 'simplification', 'treason', 'advancement', 'need', 'diplomacy', 'sin', 'direction', 'baby', 'improvement', 'rome', 'satisfaction', 'step', 'army', 'handful', 'term', 'chokepoint', 'stuff', 'danger', 'militia', 'way', 'determine', 'drive', 'heir', 'defiance', 'rendition', 'flaw', 'rest', 'troop', 'combat', 'end_turn', 'place', 'faction', 'date', 'yodas', 'flow', 'crusader', 'regen', 'information', 'mechanic', 'style', 'lousy', 'figure', 'series', 'mess', 'warhammer', 'barricade', 'china', 'empire', 'long_time', 'family', 'romance_mode', 'bff', 'reinvigoration', 'character', 'bathwater', 'reason', 'kingslike', 'philosophy', 'recruitment', 'addition', 'effort', 'townsiege', 'work', 'three_kingdoms', 'bonus', 'old_age', 'symbol', 'charge', 'comparison', 'campaign', 'death', 'cash', 'idea', 'kind', 'panel', 'review', 'turn', 'attack', 'man', 'spreadsheet', 'blob', 'population', 'filter', 'screen', 'management', 'dialogue', 'arcadey']",125,"unit, battle, faction, army, general, character, diplomacy, campaign, hero, building",1

CA have really outdone themselves with this game, from launch it's ran smoothly for me with no problems at all, playing on max settings I never seem to dip below 70 FPS, even during intense battles. The A.I (for the most part) seems decent, although they do appear to be able to spawn multiple armies out of nowhere even when they've had their economy badly damaged. I've not encountered a single bug in nearly 30 hours of game-play which for a total war game on launch is extremely impressive, although I have heard of some bugs from others (and some which have been patched as of this review). The game can sometimes be overwhelming towards the end with the amount of enemies you have to fight at once, but I thought the challenge really added to the game more than it took away. 
I seriously recommend this game to total war fans, and newer players alike since it's really easy to get in to, but with enough new material for older fans to enjoy. 

TLDR: While scores don't necessarily matter, i'd give three kingdoms a solid 8/10 and would highly encourage you to try it for yourself.

2557,Game Stability,"I have been a long time total war fan, but have only played Rome 1&2 before 3kingdoms, so take this review how you want.

First off i have to say i can only enjoy a game when i fully understand it and when i know everything there is to know. And with three kingdoms this is one of the difficulties that arises. There is so much to learn that learning all of it without watching tutorials and playthroughs and pressing F1 every 5 minutes is simply impossible. At the time of writing this review all of my hours played (a mere eight) have all been just straight up learning how to play and switching between characters/campains to see why i need a blue building instead of a green one.

Besides having to go through the learning process (which never really ends) you have to constantly be aware of everything and think about more than three things at a time before making a decision, the game is really heavy on thinking before you act. Maybe im just all-round describing a strategy game here in general, but it really feels like the thought process and mind game in total war three kingdom plays a much much bigger role than it has before (again, i only played rome 1&2).

At this moment you are probably waiting for the part where i say why i still think it is a great game and deserves a thumbs up, but then you would be wrong because i already have. The thing i like MOST about 3kingdoms is that you have to think about every little detail if you want to win. This makes it so much more rewarding to win a battle or a campaign even, than in Rome 1&2 where if wanted to be sure you were going to win, you'd just spam out two full armies with legionaries. 

Behind this story of improvement is a rework/improvement of almost every mechanic in the game and it is great. It is just good. Everything works. If something is wrong with the game, it's probably your pc and not the game.

The only thing i don't like about the game is that i cant move around the map by holding right click en moving my mouse.",0.660300016,"['long_time', 'fan', 'rome', '3kingdom', 'review', 'three_kingdoms', 'difficulty', 'tutorial', 'playthrough', 'f1', 'minute', 'time_writing', 'review', 'hour', 'learning', 'play', 'switching', 'characterscampain', 'learning', 'process', 'decision', 'thinking', 'act', 'strategy', 'process', 'mind', 'three_kingdom', 'role', 'rome', 'moment', 'thumb', '3kingdom', 'win', 'win', 'battle', 'campaign', 'rome', 'spam', 'army', 'legionary', 'story', 'improvement', 'reworkimprovement', 'mechanic', 'map', 'click', 'mouse']",47,"['long_time', 'role', '3kingdom', 'win', 'spam', 'strategy', 'story', 'playthrough', 'process', 'click', 'difficulty', 'thumb', 'battle', 'minute', 'thinking', 'f1', 'decision', 'three_kingdom', 'three_kingdoms', 'mouse', 'act', 'reworkimprovement', 'characterscampain', 'tutorial', 'mechanic', 'legionary', 'switching', 'campaign', 'fan', 'time_writing', 'learning', 'mind', 'rome', 'improvement', 'review', 'army', 'moment', 'hour', 'play', 'map']",40,"campaign, hour, issue, battle, bug, crash, multiplayer, review, rome, fix",0

Launch optimization tends to be bad, content tends to feel a little bare, and while the game is fun it usually takes a few months (and maybe a few mods) to really feel the Total War joy.

However, just as an empire long united must divide, a trend long standing must be broken. Total War: Three Kingdoms may be among the best optimized launches I have seen in the last few years. The refreshing of mechanics keeps gameplay fresh, rewarding, and exciting. The gameplay pace is taking me a while to figure out, but this has kept me engaged as I find myself contending with the chaos of a China at war.

Graphically, the game is superb, and runs far better on my machine than prior TW titles despite the notable graphical enhancements. This also has an impact on the weight of battles: with the new extreme unit size and tracking of commandery populations, war's cost is notably tangible.

Pros.
+ Fantastic battles.
+ Amazing graphics.
+ Smooth running Game.
+ immersion.
+ Diplomacy that works and feels real.
+ Rpg elements with heroes.
+ Ui, tech tree, buildings, heroes, built around the era and culture.
+ Basic family tree. (great starting point)
+ Strong early and mid game and an alright end game.
+ Yellow turbans <3.


Cons
- Family tree is a little basic needs deeper mechanics and tracking.
- Individual factions need more unique mechanics to differentiate in campaign and more unique units overall.
- Creation of children in game is picky and currently has some flaws. 
- Overall just more polish. ( no game is perfect)
- Deserted areas of the map need factions asap.
- End game lacking a rewarding feeling of truly creating a dynasty.

I firmly believe future updates and dlc will fix all cons and add to all the pros.

Recommended 10/10.

2739,Series Authenticity,"An incredible return to the historical roots of the series. The revamped diplomatic system presents players to explore other play-styles beyond your typical full-stack armies hopping from one enemy province to the next. Coalitions are encouraged, if not always a necessity, and the introduction of multiple trade-able is a welcome addition to help mix things up from previous titles. Want to stockpile food to sell to the rest of China at an inflated price? You now can!

I didn't think I would enjoy Romance mode, as I wasn't a fan of Warhammer and it's powerful generals, magic, monsters etc. But I'm happy to say that I love it and the heroes/characters. Racking up several hundred kills with a general can be very rewarding but with a risk - they are not indestructible. I have lost a number of powerful and significant characters as I was too busy micro-managing cavalry elsewhere on the map. Read beware: if you're not careful, you characters will die.

I suppose that is a bit of a statement about the era. A tumultuous time where any slight mistake can have disastrous consequences and it is that raising of the stakes that makes the game so much more enjoyable and re-playable. I had no prior interest in the Ancient China but - as is the way with Total War games - I have now done bits of reading here and there to learn about the period and the main players involved. Fascinating stuff.

Ultimately, this is by far my favourite of the series to date. Shogun II sat atop that throne and I honestly was not expecting it to be usurped by 3K. I was wrong. The king is dead; long live the king.

-Best diplomacy system of the series.
-Character driven romance mode( I see this as a positive, others might not). A more traditional mode, a records mode is also available. 
-The addition of RPG elements in game adds immersion to the game.
-Highly polished game.

The bad:
-No significant improvement on the battle side.
-Lack of unit variety (can be expanded  upon through dlcs)
-Some game mechanics are not well explained and require further search by the players (e.g. corruption, building chains).
-The Three Kingdoms lore and its characters might not appeal to everyone, but as the characters play an important part in the game, I can see how some might be turned off by them.

Campaign is probably one of the best in the series however AI still cheats
Diplomancy is amazing in this one compared to the others vast improvement but still requires some work that CA will never put in.

ISSUES:
- Unit Combat/animations  have taken a huge hit only with improvement with the generals. Literally Rome Total War 2 has better unit to unit combat. Also units/cavalry don't put up their shields while being pelted with 1000s of arrows.
- Retreat with ambushed is broken. The evac point is useless
- Arrow Trails looked like they were made by an intern
- Unit replishment is a little too hard for AI and player but need a mechanic for player/ai to not get screwed after losing one battle, and time before next attack from a huge army if loses are met

Great effort. I usually dislike a title setting that is restricted to a single culture (like Shogun), but this surprised me in every way. The new creativity in 'Heros' system is awesome and  perfectly links it the experience I have had in Dynasty Warriors.

1047,Tactical Gameplay,"So far I am really enjoying Three Kingdoms. The Beta patch which fixed birth rates and lowered Yuan Sho's (think that is the right Yuan :) ) tendency to vassalize everybody by turn 10 makes the game much more playable, especially if you start near him.  The combat is a bit more challenging than some of the other Total War games I have played and your Generals definitely play a big role in battles. One of the things I find confusing is that everytime the leader changes or a faction progresses to the next level the name of the faction changes so it is hard to keep track of who you like and who you don't.  Also a lot of the flags are very similar so again it takes some time to figure out who is who on the map. That is about the only thing i don't like about the game, that and the fact that there are so many characters with similar names it can be hard to keep them straight.

In some campaigns it was infuriating that created an unattackable power bloc that forced massive 10-15 faction wars. Other times It was great if you managed to become part of a suitably large alliance of your own, but expect to fact 6-8 full stacks alone if you don't have an alliance backing you, besides that problem thats easily patched, the series has numerous improvements which serve for an enjoyable improvement over previous Total Wars.

2980,Tactical Gameplay,"Only around turn 30 into the Cao Cao campaign, and only the Romance mode, but from my limited time so far it's a good'un. Bit of a shocker if you're coming straight from TW:WH though as the interface and mechanics differ quite a lot. The diplomacy feels much more fleshed out and I feel like I actually have options, and the character/court system with assignments and persistent retinues makes me feel like I'm actually doing something that approaches managing a dynasty. Missions are helpful and give you the occasional significant choice.
Info buttons abound so the interface doesn't remain obscure for long, but it is rather clunky in areas. Graphically the depth blur can get a bit much but when it works it's beautiful, colourful without being overly cartoony, both in campaign and battle. The soundtrack sits in the background and does it's job well, calming you as you plot your rise to the seat of emperor. Voice acting is a bit... eh but the sound design can also be beautiful, with rain fading away to a muted patter if you zoom out on the map and taunts flying during battle.

With only a few armies and battles under my belt, my commentary there is limited. AI isn't much smarter than Total War AI ever is, and enemy armies are abysmal at protecting vital units or flanking. Battles can be over as quickly as TW:WH but the pacing feels more deliberate, allowing you to manage a number of units without typically feeling overwhelmed. The unit variety in terms of type and tier seems suitably specialised to different factions (and lords?) but I've focused my early reforms (research) into agriculture and commerce so I'm mostly low tier units right now.

Overall TL;DR: Pretty, decent middle ground between fantasy and history TW in the Romance mode, good campaign so far, battles are fun but AI is a bit dumb, food makes good political fodder (heh).

3454,Characters,"The year is 192, Ma Teng headed south towards the small town of Wudu, setting a trap for the Yellow Turban army led by illostreous rebel leader Gong Du.   The trap however was foiled,  outnumbered Ma Teng's noble retainer Pang De fell in the line of duty.   Oaths were sworn on that day, and  the next year Ma Teng returned to Wudu with a vengeance, slaying Gong Du, and put down the rebellion in the year 193.  The next ten years are spent solidifying his control of the West, as Ma Teng bides his time to strike out against the tyrants holding the emperor hostage.  Now the year is 210,  adviced by the wise Sima Yi,  Ma Teng once again strikes the drums of war, and vows vengeance upon those that desecrate the Emperor of the Han.  

That was my first 10 hours or so of the game,  honestly it feels so immersive, runs like a charm loading times are shorter, game is in other words well optimized.   Battles are pretty tough, and the campaign is pretty darn tough.   Maintaining officer satisfactions are pretty hard.   

 So far I have nothing to complain about, I expect each and every campaign to become unique, on this game, Lady Wu has become the second strongest warlord on the map, going as far as vassalizing the number one Liu Bei, who seemingly lost his sworn brother Zhang Fei cause he's in an army threatening my northern border.

Game is really good, looks quite nice (though tries to overheat PC a bit and caused several total freezes before patches). Unit diversity is less than I wanted (only 1 artillery option is disappointing, when I've heard about China setting, first thought was about rockets), but really better than Shogun 2 and cavalry is finally viable/musthave. Diplomacy got a bit better and may be useful when you finally learn names of factions. Espionage got more interesting, now you must think whom you're hiring and your spies may become total failure (mostly) or help you a lot, if you're lucky.
